// Ambient types for the Vite `?worker` imports used by the Monaco-backed
// JsonEditor. Vite resolves a `?worker` import to the default export of a
// zero-argument Worker subclass constructor; declare that shape so the strict
// TypeScript build (which has no `vite/client` types referenced) can type them.
