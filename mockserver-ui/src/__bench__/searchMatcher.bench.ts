/**
 * Item 5 of commit e09495682: the `searchTextCache` WeakMap behind
 * `cachedJsonText`, used by the deep-search fallback of `matchesItemSearch`.
 *
 * When a search term is not satisfied by an extracted field, the matcher falls
 * back to scanning `JSON.stringify(value)`. Without a cache that ran once per
 * row on every keystroke AND on every ~1/sec push while a term is active.
 *
 * The bench forces the fallback path: the term `needle` only appears deep inside
 * the response body (never in an extracted field), so every item must be
 * serialized. OLD serializes on every call; NEW serializes each stable
 * reference at most once (steady-state cache hits — the keystroke/re-push case).
