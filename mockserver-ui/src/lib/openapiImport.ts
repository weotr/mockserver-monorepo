/**
 * Discover every operationId the server will use for an inline JSON spec, in

 * Mirrors {@link discoverNamedExamples} in input handling: only an inline JSON
 * payload is inspected (a URL or YAML payload is sent untouched and yields an
 * empty list). Unlike that function this returns ALL operations, not only those
 * with two or more named examples.
 *
 * This is needed because the server treats `operationsAndResponses` as an
 * operation FILTER (OpenAPIConverter only emits an expectation for an operation
 * whose id is a key of that map). So when the user pins a named example for one
 * operation, every other operation must still appear in the map — with a
 * default-preserving value — or it would be silently dropped from the import.
 *
 * For an operation WITHOUT an explicit `operationId`, the server synthesizes one
 * (see `OpenAPIParser.synthesizeOperationIds`) of the exact form
 * `"<UPPERCASE_METHOD> <path>"`, e.g. `"GET /pets"`. We replicate that format
 * byte-for-byte (see {@link synthesizeOperationId}) so the synthesized key is a
 * key of `operationsAndResponses` too — otherwise an id-less operation would be
 * filtered out and silently dropped whenever ANY example is pinned.
 *
 * Limitation: the server disambiguates colliding ids by appending ` (n)` (see
 * `OpenAPIParser.ensureUnique`). We do not replicate that here — a synthesized
 * id can only collide with an authored id that happens to equal `"METHOD path"`,
 * or with another synthesized id for the same method+path (impossible within one
 * pathItem). In the unlikely collision case the server renames its synthesized
 * id and that operation falls back to the server default — never dropped — so
 * the data-loss path stays closed.
