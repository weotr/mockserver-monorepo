# demo-opencode-proxy.sh
# ----------------------
# OPTIONAL companion to `npm run demo`. Generates REAL, non-deterministic LLM
# traffic by running OpenCode (https://opencode.ai) headless with its HTTPS
# traffic proxied through MockServer, so MockServer captures the actual LLM API
# calls. You can then open the dashboard Optimise tab — or curl the optimisation
# report — to see cost-optimisation signals computed from your own agent run.
#
# This is DELIBERATELY NOT part of `npm run demo`: the default demo is offline
# and deterministic (mocked traffic). This script needs network access and YOUR
# OWN LLM API key, and produces traffic that varies run to run.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Starts MockServer (Docker) as an HTTPS forward proxy with a dynamically
#      generated, machine-local CA (so no published private key is trusted).
#   2. Extracts that CA certificate to a local file.
#   3. Prints the exact environment to run OpenCode headless through the proxy
#      (HTTPS_PROXY + NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS / SSL_CERT_FILE), and — if you pass a
#      prompt — runs `opencode run` for you.
#   4. Tells you how to view the captured traffic and the optimisation report.
#
# Requirements: docker, curl. For step 3: opencode on your PATH and a provider
# API key exported in your shell (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).
# This script NEVER hardcodes or logs your API key.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/demo-opencode-proxy.sh                 # start proxy + print run instructions
#   ./scripts/demo-opencode-proxy.sh "refactor the foo() function and add a test"
#                                                    # start proxy + run OpenCode with that prompt
#   ./scripts/demo-opencode-proxy.sh --port 1080 "summarise the README"
#   ./scripts/demo-opencode-proxy.sh --stop          # stop and remove the proxy container
#   ./scripts/demo-opencode-proxy.sh --help
#
# Press Ctrl+C (or run with --stop) to tear down the proxy.
