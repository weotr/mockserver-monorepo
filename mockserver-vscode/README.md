# MockServer for VS Code

**Author, record, and debug HTTP/HTTPS mocks without leaving your editor.**

- **Zero-config schema authoring** — write expectation files with validation, completion, and hover, no language server to install.
- **Record real traffic into code** — turn proxied requests into loadable JSON or a MockServerClient Java DSL.
- **Live dashboard inside the editor** — watch requests arrive in a VS Code tab.

[MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com) is an HTTP(S) mock server and proxy for testing. This
extension brings the full authoring-to-debugging workflow into VS Code — and works against any
running MockServer instance, with optional one-click Docker start/stop for local development.

## Why you'll love it

### Schema-driven authoring — no language server required

*Validation, completion, enum suggestions, and hover docs the moment you name a file `*.mockserver.json`.*

Name a file `*.mockserver.json` or `*.mockserver.jsonc` and the editor validates it against the same
JSON schema MockServer uses internally. You get inline error squiggles, property autocompletion, enum
suggestions, and hover documentation without ever starting the server. A file may hold a single
expectation object or an array (initialization JSON); `.jsonc` files allow comments and trailing commas.

### Record real traffic into code — the fast path to a mock

*Proxy real traffic, then save what MockServer recorded as loadable JSON or a ready-to-paste Java DSL.*

Point MockServer at a real upstream as a proxy, exercise your app, then run **Save Recorded
Expectations (JSON or Java)**. Choose **JSON** to get a `*.mockserver.json` file you can load straight
back in, or **Java** to get a `MockServerClient` DSL you can paste into a test. If nothing has been
proxied yet, the command tells you instead of opening an empty file — no guessing.

### MockServer side panel + docked dashboard

*A MockServer view in the Activity Bar puts every action one click away, and the live dashboard docks in the bottom panel — all inside VS Code, none of it mixed in with your editor tabs.*

Click the **MockServer** icon in the Activity Bar for a panel of grouped, one-click actions — **Server**
(start / dashboard / reset), **Author** (load / record / generate from OpenAPI), **Inspect** (send request /
request log / drift / trace), and **WASM** — with a status line showing the configured `localhost:<port>`.
Run **Open Dashboard** to reveal the real MockServer dashboard **docked in the bottom panel** (its own
"MockServer Dashboard" view — active expectations, the request log, and live traffic, full width and separate
from your code tabs). Prefer your browser? **Open Dashboard in Browser** opens the same URL there.

## 30-second quick start

1. Create `login.mockserver.json` — the editor validates the schema as you type.
2. **Start a server:** run **MockServer: Start (Docker)** for a local container, or point the
   extension at an already-running server by setting `mockserver.port` (and `mockserver.dockerImage`
   / `mockserver.containerName` if relevant).
3. **Load it:** click the **Load into running MockServer** CodeLens at the top of the file (also in the
   editor title bar and right-click menu) to push your expectation(s) to the server.
4. **Watch it:** run **MockServer: Open Dashboard** (or click the status item in the MockServer side panel)
   and send a request to see it arrive in the docked dashboard.

Open the **MockServer** view in the Activity Bar for one-click access to every action, and a
**MockServer :&lt;port&gt;** entry sits in the status bar — click it any time for a quick menu of the
most common actions (Open Dashboard, Start, Stop, View Request Log).

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.80+
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) — only for **Start / Stop**; every
  other command works against any running MockServer instance.

### Installation

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mockserver.mockserver)
or search for **MockServer** in the Extensions view. For Open VSX (Eclipse Theia, Gitpod, etc.), install
from [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/extension/mockserver/mockserver).

## Everything the extension does

### Expectation files — CodeLens, menus, and snippets

At the top of every expectation file two CodeLens actions appear:

| CodeLens | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Load into running MockServer** | Sends the file's expectation(s) to `PUT /mockserver/expectation` on the configured port |
| **Diff against live** | Fetches the server's active expectations and opens a side-by-side diff against your file |

Both are also Command Palette commands. The same file-scoped actions appear in the editor **title bar**
and the **right-click (editor context) menu** whenever a `*.mockserver.json`, `*.mockserver.jsonc`, or
`*.mockserver-request.json` file is open, and are hidden from the Command Palette when no matching file
is active.

**Snippets** — in any `.json` or `.jsonc` file, type a prefix and press Tab:

| Prefix | Inserts |
|--------|---------|
| `mockserver-expectation` | Request matcher + HTTP response stub |
| `mockserver-forward` | Request matcher + forward action |
| `mockserver-verify` | Verification request template |

### Generate and record expectations

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Generate Expectations From OpenAPI Spec** | With an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (JSON or YAML) open, sends it to `PUT /mockserver/openapi` and opens the generated expectations in a new tab. Save as `*.mockserver.json` to keep them. |
| **Save Recorded Expectations (JSON or Java)** | Retrieves expectations the server recorded while proxying real traffic (`PUT /mockserver/retrieve?type=recorded_expectations`). Choose **JSON** (loadable as `*.mockserver.json`) or **Java** (MockServerClient DSL). If nothing has been proxied yet, the command says so rather than opening an empty file. |

### Inspect and control

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **View Request Log** | Opens the requests the server has received as pretty JSON in a new tab (`PUT /mockserver/retrieve?type=requests&format=json`). |
| **Find Requests by Trace** | Prompts for a W3C `traceparent` value or bare 32-hex trace id, then opens every request belonging to that distributed trace in a new JSON tab. |
| **View Trace in Backend** | The inverse correlation: prompts for a W3C `traceparent` or bare trace id, then opens the correlated OpenTelemetry trace in your trace backend (Jaeger / Tempo / Grafana) by substituting the trace id into the configurable `mockserver.traceUrlTemplate` (e.g. `http://localhost:16686/trace/{traceId}`). With no template set it copies the trace id to the clipboard and offers to configure the template. |
| **Send Test Request** | Fires the request described by a `*.mockserver-request.json` file at the running server and shows `HTTP <status>` + body (pretty-printed when JSON) in a new tab. A **Send to MockServer** CodeLens appears at the top of the file. |
| **Show Drift Report** | Fetches drift records (`GET /mockserver/drift`) and shows a readable one-line-per-record report. Drift is captured when MockServer proxies traffic and a matching stub expectation differs structurally from the real upstream response. |
| **Show Drift as Diagnostics** | Maps each drift record to the matching expectation line in the open `*.mockserver.json` file as an inline diagnostic (error / warning / info). Re-run to refresh; no drift clears them. Each diagnostic carries a **lightbulb quick-fix** — "update stub to match upstream" — that swaps the stub's declared value for the value the real upstream now returns (or falls back to "diff against live" when the value can't be located unambiguously). |
| **Reset (Clear Expectations & Logs)** | Clears all expectations and the request log (`PUT /mockserver/reset`) after a confirmation prompt. |

### Test/code-aware gutters

Open a Java, Kotlin, JS/TS, Groovy, or Scala file that uses MockServer and a **run/inspect CodeLens** appears
above each usage site it finds — `new MockServerClient(...)`, a JUnit 5 `@MockServerSettings` annotation, or a
Testcontainers `MockServerContainer`. Clicking it reveals the docked dashboard for the configured instance.
Detection is a best-effort regex scan, not a full parse, so an occasional extra lens is harmless.

### In-IDE HTTP debugger (breakpoints)

Pause real traffic flowing through MockServer and inspect/modify it without leaving the editor.

> **Prerequisite:** breakpoints fire **only on traffic flowing through MockServer** — proxied/forwarded
> exchanges, matched mock responses, and the unmatched-404 path. Point your app at MockServer as a proxy or mock
> endpoint first; this is not a JVM-style attach to an arbitrary process.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Open Debugger (Breakpoints)** | Opens the debugger panel and connects the breakpoint callback WebSocket (`/_mockserver_callback_websocket`). A status dot shows the connection state. |
| **Add Breakpoint Matcher** | Prompts for a path regex, an optional method, and the phases to pause at, then registers a matcher (`PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher`) owned by the debugger's callback-WS client. |
| **Clear All Breakpoints** | Removes all registered breakpoint matchers (`PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher/clear`). |

When a matching request flows through MockServer, the paused exchange appears in the panel:

- **REQUEST phase** — **Continue** (forward the original), **Modify** (edit the request JSON, then forward), or
  **Abort** (write a response downstream without forwarding). Abort is REQUEST-phase only.
- **RESPONSE phase** — **Continue** (write the original response) or **Modify** (edit the response JSON).
- **Stream frames** (SSE/chunked/gRPC/WebSocket) — per frame: **Continue / Modify / Inject / Drop / Close**
  (frame bodies are Base64).

The server's safety rails apply unchanged: paused exchanges auto-continue after `breakpointTimeoutMillis`
(30s default), at most `breakpointMaxHeld` (50) are held at once, and disconnecting the panel cleans up the
debugger's matchers.

### LLM authoring, call graph, chaos, and contract tests

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Show Agent-Run Call Graph** | Fetches the agent-run call graph (via the `explain_agent_run` MCP tool) and renders it as a Mermaid flowchart in a Markdown tab — the same graph the dashboard draws. |
| **Show Chaos Experiment Status** | Reads `GET /mockserver/chaosExperiment` and shows the current experiment's status and stage progress. |
| **Stop Chaos Experiment** | Stops and clears the running experiment (`DELETE /mockserver/chaosExperiment`) after a confirmation. |
| **Run OpenAPI Contract Test** | Runs the active OpenAPI spec against a service URL via `PUT /mockserver/contractTest` and opens a per-operation pass/fail report with validation errors. |

Inside an `httpLlmResponse` block of a `*.mockserver.json` file you also get **authoring completion** for
provider names, representative model names, and the block's fields.

### Dashboard

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Open Dashboard** | Reveals the dashboard docked in the bottom panel (the "MockServer Dashboard" view) — `http://localhost:<port>/mockserver/dashboard` in a webview, kept separate from your editor tabs. |
| **Open Dashboard in Browser** | Opens the same URL in the system browser. |

### WASM custom rules

MockServer supports WebAssembly custom-rule modules for body matching (requires `wasmEnabled=true` on
the server). Manage modules without leaving VS Code:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Upload WASM Module** | Opens a file picker for a `.wasm` file, prompts for a module name (defaulting to the file's basename), and uploads it via `PUT /mockserver/wasm/modules?name=<name>`. |
| **List WASM Modules** | Retrieves the names of all registered modules (`GET /mockserver/wasm/modules`) and opens them as JSON in a new tab. |

Once uploaded, reference a module in an expectation body matcher:

```json
{
  "httpRequest": {
    "body": { "type": "WASM", "moduleName": "myRule" }
  },
  "httpResponse": { "statusCode": 200 }
}
```

If WASM support is disabled on the server, the server's own error message is surfaced verbatim.

### Docker lifecycle

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Start (Docker)** | Runs `docker run -d --rm --name <containerName> -p <port>:1080 <image>`. Checks that Docker is running and that the container is not already active. |
| **Stop** | Stops the named container with `docker stop <containerName>`. |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `mockserver.dockerImage` | _(empty)_ | Docker image for **Start (Docker)**. Empty defaults to `mockserver/mockserver:<extension-version>`, keeping the image tag in lockstep with the extension release. |
| `mockserver.containerName` | `mockserver-vscode` | Name of the container started and stopped by the extension. |
| `mockserver.port` | `1080` | Host port mapped to the container's port 1080. Used for the dashboard URL and all API commands. |
| `mockserver.traceUrlTemplate` | _(empty)_ | URL template for **View Trace in Backend**. The `{traceId}` placeholder is replaced with the W3C trace id, e.g. `http://localhost:16686/trace/{traceId}` (Jaeger) or `https://grafana.example.com/explore?...&traceId={traceId}` (Tempo/Grafana). Empty just surfaces the trace id. |

## File conventions

| File pattern | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `*.mockserver.json` | Expectation file — JSON schema validation, CodeLens (Load + Diff), title-bar & right-click menus, snippet support |
| `*.mockserver.jsonc` | Same as above, but allows comments and trailing commas |
| `*.mockserver-request.json` | Scratch request file — CodeLens (**Send to MockServer**), title-bar & right-click menu, used by **MockServer: Send Test Request** |

**Scratch request file format** (`*.mockserver-request.json`):

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/resource",
  "headers": { "Accept": "application/json" },
  "body": ""
}
```

`method` and `path` are required; `headers` and `body` are optional.

## Try it locally

From the repo root, one command builds the extension, starts a local MockServer, loads sample files,
and opens a sandboxed VS Code Extension Development Host — nothing to install or uninstall:

```bash
scripts/try-editor-extensions.sh           # VS Code Extension Development Host
scripts/try-editor-extensions.sh --install # or install the packaged .vsix into your VS Code
```

## Building from source

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm test
```

## Packaging

```bash
npx vsce package
```

Produces a `.vsix` file installable via `code --install-extension mockserver-*.vsix`.
