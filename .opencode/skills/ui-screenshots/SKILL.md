  Regenerate the MockServer dashboard screenshots used on www.mock-server.com by
  driving a populated demo dashboard with headless Chromium (Playwright). Use
  when the dashboard UI has changed and the website screenshots
  (jekyll-www.mock-server.com/images/MockServer*.png) need refreshing, or when
  asked to "update the UI screenshots", "regenerate dashboard screenshots", or
  "take screenshots of the dashboard for the docs". Captures one Retina PNG per
  tab at the same geometry as the existing images.

# Regenerate Dashboard Documentation Screenshots

Refresh the website's dashboard screenshots after UI changes. The flow brings up
a fully-populated demo dashboard, then captures one crisp PNG per tab at the same
geometry as the existing images so they drop in with no `<img>` edits.

## TL;DR

```bash
cd mockserver-ui
npm install                       # first time only — fetches playwright
npx playwright install chromium   # first time only — fetches the browser binary
npm run screenshots:all           # demo up → capture every tab → demo down
```

`screenshots:all` writes 17 PNGs straight into
`jekyll-www.mock-server.com/images/` (the live website paths). Review the diff,
then commit the changed images.

## How it works

`screenshots:all` runs the demo in **two phases**, because load injection and the
screenshots want opposite things (see "Why two phases" below):

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph P1["Phase 1 — content tabs"]
    A1["demo --with-broker\n(NO load injection)"] --> A2["capture 15 content tabs\n(Traffic, Sessions, Mocks, Chaos, …)"]
  end
  subgraph P2["Phase 2 — chart tabs"]
    B1["demo --with-broker --with-load-injection"] --> B2["warm up ~90s"] --> B3["capture Metrics + Performance"]
  end
  P1 --> P2 --> C["MockServer<Tab>.png → jekyll-www.../images/"]
```

Each phase: background `npm run demo`, wait for the "Ready — populated demo
environment" line, run the Playwright capture, tear the demo down (trap EXIT).

Two scripts, both in `mockserver-ui/scripts/`:

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| `capture-docs-screenshots.sh` | Orchestrator — runs both demo phases, captures, tears down. `npm run screenshots:all`. |
| `capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs` | The Playwright capture — assumes the dashboard is **already running**, waits for the WebSocket to show "Connected", navigates each tab, drives it into a rich state, shoots. `npm run screenshots`. |

### Curated tab states

The capture doesn't just navigate — for several tabs it drives a richer
documentation state (each is a best-effort `prepare` step in the `.mjs`; a
failure is logged and the shot still happens):

| Tab | What the shot shows |
|-----|---------------------|
| Traffic | an LLM exchange selected with the **Conversation** tab open (multi-turn messages + tool calls) |
| Mocks (Composer) | the **Advanced** expectation editor, not Quick mode |
| Chaos | the **HTTP Service Chaos** section expanded (form fields) with the other sections collapsed |
| Metrics / Performance | charts warmed up so the time-series are drawn, not "collecting…" |

### Why two phases

The dashboard keeps only the most recent **~100** traffic items. A load scenario
firing thousands of requests/sec evicts the seeded LLM conversations (and can
saturate the WebSocket so panels never reach "Connected"). So content tabs are
shot against a **quiet** demo. The **Metrics/Performance** charts, conversely,
need live sustained throughput to draw non-empty series — so they get their own
load-injection phase with a warm-up. Set `SKIP_CHARTS=true` to run only phase 1.

## Matching the existing screenshots

The clarity of the current images comes from **Retina capture**: a 1920-wide
viewport at `deviceScaleFactor: 2`, producing ~3840px-wide PNGs. The capture
script defaults to exactly this (`WIDTH=1920 HEIGHT=900 SCALE=2`). Keep these to
stay consistent with the on-site images. Filenames reuse the existing
`MockServer<Name>.png` convention, so regenerated tabs overwrite in place.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker running** if you pass `--with-broker` (the Async tab's recorded
  messages need a Mosquitto broker). Without it, drop `--with-broker`.
- **Node via nvm** — the repo's node is nvm-managed (v22.x). Homebrew node (v26)
  breaks the UI build. If `node` is shadowed by an `_load_nvm` shell function,
  use the absolute path `~/.nvm/versions/node/v22*/bin/node`.
- **Playwright browser** installed once: `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Common variations

```bash
cd mockserver-ui

# Content tabs only — skip the slower phase-2 load-injection chart pass:
SKIP_CHARTS=true npm run screenshots:all

# Capture into a scratch dir first to eyeball before overwriting the live images:
OUT_DIR=.tmp/shots npm run screenshots:all

# Longer chart warm-up (default 90s) for fuller Metrics/Performance series:
CHART_WARMUP_S=180 npm run screenshots:all

# Iterate on one screen against an already-running demo (two terminals):
npm run demo -- --with-broker                          # terminal 1 (quiet demo)
ONLY=traffic,composer,chaos npm run screenshots        # terminal 2
```

The orchestrator passes `--with-broker` itself; you don't add demo flags to
`screenshots:all`. To drive a demo you started yourself, use `npm run
screenshots` (the bare capture) with `ONLY=` / `OUT_DIR=` as needed.

### Orchestrator knobs (env vars on `capture-docs-screenshots.sh`)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `SKIP_CHARTS` | `false` | `true` → run only phase 1 (content tabs) |
| `CHART_WARMUP_S` | `90` | phase-2 warm-up before shooting the charts |
| `DEMO_TIMEOUT` | `300` | seconds to wait for each demo to report ready |

### Capture knobs (env vars on `capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs`)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `ONLY` | all | comma-separated tab values (`dashboard,chaos,metrics,…`) |
| `OUT_DIR` | `jekyll-www.mock-server.com/images` | where PNGs are written |
| `WIDTH` / `HEIGHT` | `1920` / `900` | CSS viewport |
| `SCALE` | `2` | deviceScaleFactor (Retina) |
| `FULL_PAGE` | `false` | `true` captures full scroll height instead of one viewport |
| `THEME` | `light` | `light` or `dark` colour scheme |
| `SETTLE_MS` | `1200` | default settle before each shot (per-tab overrides apply) |
| `CHART_SETTLE_MS` / `SLOW_SETTLE_MS` | `8000` / `6000` | settle for chart tabs / slow-loading tabs (gRPC, Optimise, Sessions) |
| `UI_PORT` / `MS_PORT` | `3000` / `1080` | dev-server and MockServer ports |

## Tab inventory

The capture covers all 17 dashboard tabs in `NAV_TABS` order
(`mockserver-ui/src/components/AppBar.tsx`). Navigation clicks the inline
`[data-nav-tab]` toggle, falling back to the overflow / hamburger menu by
`aria-label` when a tab is collapsed. Lazy-loaded tabs (Mocks/Composer,
Performance, LLM Optimise, Metrics) wait for their "Loading…" placeholder to
clear before the shot.

| Tab value | File |
|-----------|------|
| get-started | MockServerGetStarted.png |
| dashboard | MockServerDashboard.png |
| traffic | MockServerTrafficInspector.png |
| breakpoints | MockServerBreakpoints.png |
| composer | MockServerComposer.png |
| chaos | MockServerChaos.png |
| performance | MockServerPerformance.png |
| optimise | MockServerOptimise.png |
| async | MockServerAsyncAPI.png |
| grpc | MockServerGRPC.png |
| sessions | MockServerSessions.png |
| library | MockServerLibrary.png |
| drift | MockServerDrift.png |
| verification | MockServerVerification.png |
| contract | MockServerContract.png |
| cluster | MockServerCluster.png |
| metrics | MockServerMetrics.png |

> Tabs added since the existing website images (Performance, LLM Optimise, gRPC,
> Contract, Cluster) produce **new** files. To surface them on the site, add an
> `<img>` reference in `jekyll-www.mock-server.com/mock_server/mockserver_ui.html`
> following the existing `<img class="ui_image" …>` pattern.

## After capturing

1. `git status jekyll-www.mock-server.com/images/` — confirm only intended PNGs changed.
2. Open a few PNGs to sanity-check they're fully rendered (no spinners, data present).
3. Commit the images (and any new `mockserver_ui.html` references) via the normal
   pre-commit workflow.

## Troubleshooting

- **Traffic / Sessions empty ("No captured requests yet")** — either the page
  wasn't "Connected" when shot, or load injection evicted the seeded traffic past
  the ~100-item UI cap. `screenshots:all` already shoots these in the quiet
  phase-1 demo; if running the bare capture, point it at a `npm run demo
  --with-broker` (no `--with-load-injection`).
- **A tab is blank / shows a spinner** — raise `SETTLE_MS` (or the per-tab
  `SLOW_SETTLE_MS`), or the panel needs more demo data (extend
  `mockserver-ui/scripts/populate-demo-data.mjs`).
- **Metrics/Performance charts say "collecting…"** — the demo hasn't generated
  enough samples; raise `CHART_WARMUP_S` (orchestrator) or `CHART_SETTLE_MS`.
- **A `prepare` step is skipped** (logged `! <tab> prepare step skipped`) — a UI
  selector drifted (e.g. the Advanced toggle, the Conversation tab, the HTTP
  chaos header). The shot still happens, just without the curated state; update
  the `prepare` selector in `capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs`.
- **Demo never reports ready** — check the temp log path printed by the
  orchestrator; MockServer or Vite likely failed to start (port in use, JAR build
  error). Raise `DEMO_TIMEOUT` for slow first-time JAR builds.
- **`_load_nvm: command not found`** — node is shadowed by the nvm shell
  function; invoke the absolute nvm node path (see Prerequisites).
- **Async tab empty** — Docker isn't running, so `--with-broker` was a no-op.
