/**
 * Process-wide registry of breakpoint matchers. Each entry describes a request
 * matcher and a set of phases; when a forwarded exchange matches, it is paused
 * at the corresponding phase for interactive inspection/modification.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe via a single {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} as the source of truth.
 * This is ideal for the access pattern here: reads ({@link #findMatch}) are frequent
 * and on the data plane (including the Netty event loop), while writes
 * ({@link #register}, {@link #remove}, {@link #clear}) are rare control-plane
 * operations. A single structure means register/remove/clear are atomic with respect
 * to a concurrent {@link #findMatch} — there is no window in which two backing
 * collections can disagree.
 *
 * <p><b>Event-loop safety:</b> {@link #findMatch} is designed to be called on the
 * Netty event loop for stream-frame phases. When the registry is empty, it returns
 * {@code null} immediately via a single {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList#isEmpty()} check
 * (zero allocation). When non-empty, it iterates a stable snapshot of the prebuilt
 * matchers without any blocking or allocation beyond the matcher's own match logic.
