/**
 * Per-upstream circuit breaker for forwarded/proxied requests. State is keyed by upstream
 * {@code host:port}. After {@code forwardProxyCircuitBreakerFailureThreshold} consecutive failures
 * to one upstream the breaker trips <b>open</b> and {@link #allowRequest(String)} fails subsequent
 * requests fast (the caller returns a 503) for {@code forwardProxyCircuitBreakerWindowMillis}. Once
 * the window elapses the breaker moves to <b>half-open</b>: it permits a single trial request. A
 * success ({@link #recordSuccess(String)}) closes the breaker; a failure
 * ({@link #recordFailure(String)}) re-opens it for another window.
 *
 * <p>The whole mechanism is inert unless {@code forwardProxyCircuitBreakerEnabled} is true, so the
 * default behaviour (every request attempted) is unchanged.
 *
 * <p>The singleton instance is shared process-wide, consistent with
 * {@link ChaosAutoHaltMonitor} and {@link LlmCostBudgetMonitor}. The number of currently-open
 * upstreams is exposed via {@link #openCircuitCount()} (and the {@code mock_server_upstream_circuit_open}
