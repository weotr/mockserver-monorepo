/**
 * Transport-neutral seam for resetting the request stream with an error code instead of returning a

 * <p>
 * HTTP/2 stream resets (RST_STREAM) are issued directly by
 * {@link org.mockserver.mock.action.http.HttpErrorActionHandler} on the Netty channel, because the
 * HTTP/2 frame/connection handlers are on the core classpath. HTTP/3 resets a QUIC stream
 * (RESET_STREAM) and the QUIC types live only in the netty module, so
 * {@link org.mockserver.mock.action.http.HttpActionHandler} delegates to this interface when the
 * active {@link ResponseWriter} implements it (the HTTP/3 response writer does). This keeps the
 * matching/dispatch logic in core transport-agnostic while the actual QUIC stream reset lives in the
 * netty module.
