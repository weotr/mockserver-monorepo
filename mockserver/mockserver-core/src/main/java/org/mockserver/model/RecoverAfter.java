/**
 * Declarative retry/backoff recovery primitive attached to an {@link HttpResponse}:
 * "fail the first K matches, then serve the configured success response". This lets a
 * test deterministically exercise a client's retry/backoff logic against a dependency
 * that fails transiently and then recovers.
 * <p>
 * Counting is 1-based over the expectation's match count (attempt {@code n}):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Attempts {@code 1..failTimes} serve {@code failResponse} (or, when none is
 *       configured, a default {@code 503 Service Unavailable}).</li>
 *   <li>Attempt {@code failTimes + 1} and beyond serve the configured success response.</li>
 * </ul>
 * So {@code failTimes = K} yields exactly K failures followed by success. When
 * {@code failTimes} is {@code null} or {@code <= 0} this primitive is inert and the
 * configured response is served unchanged (backward compatible).
 * <p>
 * Counting is INDEPENDENT of {@code Times}: a fail attempt still consumes a match of the
 * expectation but does not consume a {@code Times} use beyond what matching already does —
 * the expectation keeps matching across the failure window exactly as it would without
 * this primitive (see {@link org.mockserver.mock.action.http.HttpActionHandler}).
 * <p>
 * By default the failure counter is per-expectation (off the expectation's match count, so
 * no extra state is held). When {@code idempotencyHeader} is set, the counter is instead
 * keyed per {@code (expectationId, header-value)} in a node-local
 * {@link org.mockserver.mock.action.http.RecoveryAttemptRegistry}, so each distinct
 * idempotency key gets its own {@code 1..K} failure window while requests sharing a key
 * share one window. If {@code idempotencyHeader} is configured but the header is ABSENT on
 * a given request, that request falls back to the per-expectation match count.
 * <p>
 * Relationship to {@link HttpChaosProfile}: the chaos profile's
 * {@code succeedFirst}/{@code failRequestCount} count-window injects probabilistic faults
 * over a window; this primitive is a simpler, deterministic, response-level
 * "fail-then-succeed" with optional idempotency-key scoping, expressed directly on the
 * response action rather than as a chaos field.
 * <p>
 * Follows the model field/{@code withX}/getter convention so it round-trips without a
 * bespoke (de)serializer.
