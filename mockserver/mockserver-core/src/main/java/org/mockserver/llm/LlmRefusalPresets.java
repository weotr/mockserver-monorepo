/**
 * Presets that emit provider-style <em>refusals</em> — the response an aligned
 * model returns when it declines to answer on safety grounds. Mocking a refusal
 * lets an agent's refusal-handling path (retry with a softer prompt, surface a
 * user-facing message, fall back to a tool) be exercised deterministically.
 *
 * <p>The flagship is Anthropic's refusal shape: a normal HTTP 200 message whose
 * {@code stop_reason} is {@code "refusal"} (introduced alongside Claude's
 * safety-refusal stop reason) rather than {@code end_turn}. The
 * {@link #anthropicRefusal()} preset builds a {@link Completion} carrying that stop
 * reason, which the Anthropic codec encodes into the wire body; the raw wire body
 * is also exposed as {@link #ANTHROPIC_REFUSAL_BODY} for the chaos content-filter
 * block path.
 *
 * <p>All factories are static and pure; each call returns a fresh {@link Completion}.
