/**
 * Seeds an editable, runnable {@link LoadScenario} from traffic previously recorded by MockServer in
 * proxy/recording mode (the {@code RECEIVED_REQUEST} entries returned by
 * {@link org.mockserver.log.MockServerEventLog#retrieveRequests}).
 *
 * <p>This is the "record-to-load" flagship: capture real traffic through the proxy, then replay its
 * <em>shape</em> as a load test. Two modes control how the recorded requests become {@link LoadStep}s:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link Mode#VERBATIM} (default)</b> — one {@link LoadStep} per recorded request, in recorded
 *       order, preserving the concrete path, body and headers. An optional {@code maxSteps} truncates to
 *       the first N recorded requests (the orchestrator's {@code loadGenerationMaxSteps} also caps).</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link Mode#TEMPLATIZED}</b> — recorded requests are deduplicated by
 *       {@code (method, templatised-path)} using the SHARED {@link MetricLabels#routeOf(String)}
 *       templatizer (e.g. {@code /orders/123} and {@code /orders/456} collapse to one
 *       {@code /orders/{id}} route), keeping one representative example per unique route, ordered by
 *       descending hit frequency (most-hit routes first). One {@link LoadStep} is emitted per unique
 *       route, each carrying that route's observed hit COUNT as its {@link LoadStep#getWeight() weight},
 *       and the generated scenario is marked {@link LoadScenario.StepSelection#WEIGHTED WEIGHTED} so each
 *       iteration picks a route in proportion to its recorded frequency — reproducing the recorded
 *       traffic MIX.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Target precedence</b> for where each generated request is sent (carried as the request's
 * {@code Host} header and {@code secure} flag, the routing surface every load step uses):
 * <ol>
 *   <li>an explicit {@link Target} supplied by the caller (applied to every step), else</li>
 *   <li>each recorded request's existing routing is left untouched — recorded proxied requests already
 *       carry their upstream target (Host header / secure flag).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>When the caller supplies no {@link LoadProfile} the same conservative default as
 * {@link LoadScenarioFromOpenAPI} is applied — a single short constant-VU stage — so the generated
 * scenario is immediately runnable yet safe; the operator is expected to edit the profile afterward.
 *
 * <p>This is a pure generator: it produces a {@link LoadScenario} object and drives no traffic.
