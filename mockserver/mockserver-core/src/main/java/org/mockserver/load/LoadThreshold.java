/**
 * One in-run pass/fail threshold for a {@link LoadScenario}: a load metric compared against a
 * threshold value. All a scenario's thresholds must hold for the run verdict to be {@code PASS}
 * (logical AND); any breach makes the verdict {@code FAIL}.
 *
 * <p>Thresholds are evaluated on the orchestrator's control tick from <em>per-run</em> data (this
 * run's HDR latency histogram and its request counters) — never from the global
 * {@link org.mockserver.slo.SloSampleStore}, which aggregates all forward traffic rather than this
 * one run. The comparison reuses {@link SloObjective.Comparator} (and its
 * {@link SloObjective#satisfiedBy(double)} semantics) so the two features share one comparator
 * vocabulary, but a load threshold is otherwise independent of the SLO verify feature.
