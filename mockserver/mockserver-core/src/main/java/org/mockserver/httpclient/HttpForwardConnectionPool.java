/**
 * A small keyed pool of idle, reusable upstream HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections used by
 * {@link NettyHttpClient} when {@code forwardConnectionPoolEnabled} is set.
 * <p>
 * Connections are keyed by {@code host:port:secure} so that a checked-out idle channel is only
 * ever reused for an identical upstream (same host, same port, same TLS setting). The pool is
 * deliberately conservative:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Only plain HTTP/1.1 keep-alive channels are ever offered to the pool — HTTP/2, HTTP/3,
 *     binary, streaming and proxy-tunnelled channels are never pooled (the caller never releases
 *     them here).</li>
 *     <li>{@link #acquire(String)} only ever returns a channel that is still {@code isActive()};
 *     stale (server-closed) channels are discarded.</li>
 *     <li>On saturation (per-key idle limit reached) {@link #release(String, Channel)} returns
 *     {@code false} so the caller closes the surplus channel rather than blocking or failing.</li>
 *     <li>Idle channels are evicted after {@code idleTimeoutMillis} of inactivity via a one-shot
 *     close scheduled on the channel's own event loop (cancelled if the channel is re-acquired) —
 *     this reaper applies equally to keep-warm-retained channels, so a long-idle warm pool drains.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The opt-in keep-warm mode (off by default) only RAISES the per-key idle ceiling from
 * {@code maxIdleConnectionsPerKey} to {@code maxTotalConnectionsPerKey} so that, under sustained
 * high-rate low-latency forwarding, channels are retained on release instead of being closed back
 * down to the idle cap — eliminating the connection churn that otherwise caps single-instance
 * forward/inject throughput. With keep-warm off the close decision is byte-identical to the
 * historical behaviour.
 * The pool itself holds no event-loop threads and performs no I/O; it is a thread-safe index of
 * idle channels. All mutation of the per-key deques is guarded by the deque's own monitor.
