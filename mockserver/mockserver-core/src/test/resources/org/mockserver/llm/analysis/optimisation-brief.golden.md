> You are an LLM cost-optimisation expert. Below is a captured agent run that was proxied through MockServer. Identify concrete ways to reduce inference cost by (1) tightening or caching prompts, (2) moving deterministic logic out of the model into tools, and (3) moving logic into HTTP or MCP endpoints. For each opportunity, estimate the token and cost saving and show the change. Prioritise the highest-saving, lowest-risk changes first.

## Verdict

- Grade: A
- Grade A — well optimised; 3 low-impact findings noted (2 medium, 1 low), estimated saving $0.00 (0% of spend).
- Est. $0.0001 (0% of spend) / 42 tokens recoverable
- Cache hit rate: 0%
- One-shot rate: 100%

## Detected opportunities

### [MEDIUM] Identical 14-token system prompt resent on all 2 calls

The same system prompt (fingerprint a7c8f57b) was sent on 2/2 calls, re-paying for the same input tokens each turn.

- Affected calls: 0, 1
- Estimated wasted input tokens: 14
- Estimated saving: $0.0000
- Recommendation: Enable provider prompt caching, or move the static context into a retrieval tool so it is not resent every turn.
- Fix: Enable prompt caching — Automatic prefix caching — keep the static prefix byte-identical and first; do not interleave volatile content before it.

### [MEDIUM] Low cache hit rate (0%) on a repeated 14-token cacheable prefix

A cacheable prompt prefix is resent across calls but only 0% of input tokens were served from cache; 14 repeated tokens are not yet cached.

- Affected calls: 0, 1
- Estimated wasted input tokens: 14
- Estimated saving: $0.0000
- Recommendation: Enable prompt caching for the repeated static prefix so it is billed once, not on every call.
- Fix: Enable prompt caching — Automatic prefix caching — keep the static prefix byte-identical and first; do not interleave volatile content before it.

### [LOW] Unused tool schema re-sent on 2 calls (42 wasted tokens)

Tool definitions [get_weather] are sent on every request but never invoked, so their schema is paid for as input on each call.

- Affected calls: 0, 1
- Estimated wasted input tokens: 42
- Estimated saving: $0.0001
- Recommendation: Tools [get_weather] are defined on every request but never called — remove them from `tools` to stop re-sending ~42 tokens of unused schema each call.
- Fix: Remove unused tools — Tools [get_weather] are defined on every request but never called — remove them from `tools` to stop re-sending ~42 tokens of unused schema each call.
