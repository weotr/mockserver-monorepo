/**
 * Architectural-invariant guard for the "pool-on-by-default" fix: the outbound forward/proxy HTTP
 * client MUST run on an event-loop group that is a DISTINCT instance from the server worker group,
 * and its threads MUST be named distinctly ({@code MockServer-forwardClientEventLoop}).
 * <p>
 * This is the highest-value guard in the suite. The connection pool is only safe to default on
 * because a pooled keep-alive channel reused inside a synchronous local object-callback (which runs
 * ON a server worker thread and makes a blocking loopback call back to this server) is never pinned
 * to the very worker thread that is blocked in that callback — which would self-deadlock the event
 * loop. That guarantee holds only while the forward client's group is disjoint from the worker group.
 * <p>
 * If a future refactor re-shares the group (e.g. wires the forward client back to
 * {@code getEventLoopGroup()} / {@code workerGroup}), {@link #forwardClientGroupMustBeDistinctInstanceFromWorkerGroup()}
 * fails loudly: the two reflectively-read groups would be the same instance.
 * <p>
 * Proof this is a real guard (not a no-op): a temporary revert that changed {@code MockServer.java}
 * to pass {@code getEventLoopGroup()} instead of {@code getForwardClientEventLoopGroup()} into the
 * forward {@code HttpActionHandler} was run locally; with that revert the forward client shares the
 * worker group. The distinctness assertion below is on the {@code LifeCycle} fields themselves, so
 * the strongest form of this guard ({@link #forwardClientGroupFieldMustNotAliasWorkerGroupField()})
 * fails whenever the two groups are made the same instance, and the live-thread-naming assertion
 * fails whenever the forward client is wired to the worker group (forward I/O then runs on
 * {@code MockServer-workerEventLoop} threads, so no {@code MockServer-forwardClientEventLoop} thread
 * ever appears). See ForwardConnectionPoolLoopbackCallbackTest for the behavioural deadlock guard.
