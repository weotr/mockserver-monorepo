/**
 * Lifecycle / leak guard for the dedicated forward-client event-loop group introduced by the
 * "pool-on-by-default" fix. Starting and stopping a {@link MockServer} repeatedly must:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>shut the {@code forwardClientGroup} down on every stop (its termination future completes), and</li>
 *   <li>leave NO lingering {@code MockServer-forwardClientEventLoop} threads behind once the JVM has
 *       settled — otherwise each start/stop cycle would leak a thread pool.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Because the disjoint group is created in the {@code LifeCycle} constructor and torn down in
 * {@code stopAsync()}, a regression that forgets to shut it down (or shares it with a group that
 * outlives the server) would surface here as leaked threads after stop.
