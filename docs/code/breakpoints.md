# Interactive Breakpoints

**TL;DR:** A breakpoint is a request matcher + set of phases + owning `clientId`.
Register one via `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher` (with a required `clientId`).
When a request matches, the exchange is paused at each specified phase — this
covers forwarded/proxied exchanges, matched mock responses, and unmatched-404
responses (REQUEST and RESPONSE phases); streaming-frame phases remain
forward/mock-stream only. Resolution is interactive: the paused item is dispatched to the owning client
over the callback WebSocket (`/_mockserver_callback_websocket`). The client (any
language client or the dashboard, all speaking the same protocol) inspects/modifies
it and sends a decision; the server applies the decision and resumes. The four global
flags are removed -- matchers are the only activation mechanism. The callback WebSocket
is the only resolution transport.

```

Interactive breakpoints let you pause proxied/forwarded exchanges at four phases:

1. **Request breakpoints** (A1a) — hold the outbound request before it reaches the upstream server
2. **Response breakpoints** (A1b) — hold the upstream response before it is written to the client
3. **Stream frame breakpoints** (A1c + A1d) — hold each individual frame of a streaming response before it is written to the client. Covers both forwarded upstream streams (SSE / HTTP/1.1 chunked) and mock-generated streams (mock SSE/chunked, gRPC server-streaming, WebSocket eager/scripted messages, WebSocket bidirectional responses, and GraphQL subscription pushes)
4. **Inbound frame breakpoints** (A1e) — hold each client-to-server frame on bidirectional/streaming connections (WebSocket, GraphQL-subscription, and gRPC-bidi over both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3) before MockServer processes them. Enables inspection, modification, dropping, injection, and connection close for inbound frames

Request and response breakpoints support inspect, modify, continue, and abort -- interactively over the callback WebSocket.
Stream frame breakpoints and inbound frame breakpoints support continue, modify, drop, inject, and close per frame -- over the callback WebSocket.

## Non-blocking architecture

The breakpoint mechanism is fully asynchronous. The `BreakpointCallbackDispatcher` or
`StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher` serialises the paused item into a WS message and sends
it to the owning client. The continuation is chained onto a `CompletableFuture` that is
completed when the client replies or the timeout fires. No thread is blocked.

## Phases

### Request phase

- Hold points:
  - `HttpActionHandler.handleUnmatchedProxyForward`, after pre-flight validation
    but before the upstream HTTP call (unmatched / anonymous proxy forwards).
  - `HttpActionHandler.dispatchForwardWithBreakpoint`, before the upstream call for
    **matched** forward expectations (`FORWARD`, `FORWARD_TEMPLATE`,
    `FORWARD_CLASS_CALLBACK`, `FORWARD_REPLACE`, `FORWARD_VALIDATE`,
    `FORWARD_WITH_FALLBACK`). `FORWARD_OBJECT_CALLBACK` is not covered (it uses its
    own write path).
  - `HttpActionHandler.dispatchMockResponseWithBreakpoint`, before generating a
    **matched mock response** (`RESPONSE`, `RESPONSE_TEMPLATE`,
    `RESPONSE_CLASS_CALLBACK`). MODIFY feeds the modified request into template /
    class-callback generation.
  - The unmatched-**404** dispatch (no expectation matched and not proxying), before
    `returnNotFound` writes the not-found response.
- Decision actions: CONTINUE (proceed with the original request), MODIFY (proceed
  with the replacement request — forwarded upstream for forwards, or fed into
  response generation for mock/404), ABORT (write error response to the client
  without forwarding or generating the response).

### Response phase

- Hold points:
  - `HttpActionHandler.writeForwardActionResponse` (expectation-matched forwards)
    and `executeUnmatchedForward` (unmatched proxy forwards), after the upstream
    response is received but before it is written to the client.
  - `HttpActionHandler.writeResponseActionResponse`, after chaos is applied but
    before writing a **matched mock response**. Scoped by action type to
    `RESPONSE` / `RESPONSE_TEMPLATE` / `RESPONSE_CLASS_CALLBACK` so the
    protocol-specific paths that share this writer (LLM, gRPC, WebSocket, SSE) are
    not intercepted. Chaos is not re-applied after manual resolution.
  - `HttpActionHandler.returnNotFound`, before writing an unmatched-**404**
    response.
- Non-streaming (buffered) responses only — streaming responses are written
  immediately (breakpoint is skipped).
- Decision actions: CONTINUE (write original response), MODIFY (write replacement
  response), ABORT (write error response).
- The upstream `HttpResponse` is a deserialized model object (no pooled ByteBuf),
  so parking does not risk use-after-free.

### Stream frame phase

- **Hold points:**
  - `NettyResponseWriter.writeStreamingResponse` — SSE/chunked forwarded and mock
    responses (A1c). The `StreamingBody.subscribe()` onChunk callback intercepts
    each chunk before writing as a `DefaultHttpContent`.
  - `GrpcStreamResponseActionHandler.scheduleMessages` — gRPC server-streaming mock
    responses (A1d). Each gRPC message frame is intercepted before `ctx.writeAndFlush`.
  - `HttpWebSocketResponseActionHandler.scheduleMessages` — WebSocket eager/scripted
    messages (A1d). Each frame is intercepted before writing.
  - `HttpWebSocketResponseActionHandler.installBidirectionalHandler` — WebSocket
    bidirectional response frames (A1d). The FrameSender intercepts each response frame.
  - `HttpWebSocketResponseActionHandler.installGraphQLSubscriptionHandler` — GraphQL
    subscription push frames (A1d). The FrameSender intercepts each `next` message.
  - `Http3GrpcResponseWriter.scheduleStreamMessages` — gRPC server-streaming mock
    responses over HTTP/3 (QUIC). Each gRPC message DATA frame is intercepted before
    `ctx.writeAndFlush`. Uses stream-id suffix `-h3-grpc-stream` (distinct from
    HTTP/2's `-grpc-stream`). Decision callbacks run on the QUIC stream's event loop.
- Scope: all streaming response types (SSE/chunked forwarded AND mock-generated,
  gRPC server-streaming over HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, WebSocket, and GraphQL subscriptions).
- Decision actions: CONTINUE (write original frame), MODIFY (write replacement
  body), DROP (discard frame), INJECT (write original + extra frame), CLOSE
  (send stream-end signal and close the stream).
- **Backpressure:** for SSE/chunked streams, when a frame is parked,
  `streamingBody.requestMore()` is NOT called — this stops the upstream from
  sending more chunks. For gRPC server-streaming and WebSocket eager/scripted
  mock-generated streams (via `scheduleMessages`), the next message in the
  sequence is not scheduled until the current frame's decision is resolved
  (inherent backpressure via the recursive schedule chain). **Note:**
  GraphQL-subscription (`pushNextSequence`) and WebSocket-bidirectional
  response paths are fire-and-forget — they park ALL frames simultaneously
  as they arrive (driven by inbound client messages or the subscription
  sequence), which means they can hit `breakpointMaxHeld` under high
  throughput. There is no inherent backpressure in these paths because the
  frame sender is invoked per inbound event rather than chained sequentially.
- **Stream-close eviction:** when a stream completes, errors, or is explicitly
  closed, all held frames for that stream are auto-continued/dropped (preventing
  leaks and hanging futures).
- **Frame ordering:** frames within a stream are assigned monotonic sequence
  numbers. The registry enforces that frames are resolved in order — attempting
  to resolve a frame whose predecessor is still held is rejected.
- **ByteBuf discipline:** frame bytes are copied into a `byte[]` at park time.
  For SSE/chunked, the original ByteBuf (owned by StreamingBody) is released
  normally by the caller. For gRPC, frames are already `byte[]` from
  `GrpcStreamMessageEncoder.encode()`. For WebSocket, text is encoded to `byte[]`
  via UTF-8. On resume, the decision handler allocates a new
  `Unpooled.wrappedBuffer` for writing. No ByteBuf is retained across the
  breakpoint hold period.
- **gRPC framing constraint:** for gRPC streams, MODIFY and INJECT replacement
  bytes must be a valid gRPC length-prefixed frame (1-byte compressed flag +
  4-byte big-endian message length + message bytes), otherwise the client will
  see a protocol error. The breakpoint engine passes bytes through opaquely --
  it does not validate or re-frame the content.
- **Event-loop safety:** all hold-point callbacks run on the Netty event loop.
  They NEVER block — they park the frame and return immediately. The decision
  callback is marshalled onto the channel's event loop via
  `ctx.channel().eventLoop().execute(...)`.
- **Stream ID format:** forwarded streams use `{correlationId}-stream`, gRPC
  streams use `{correlationId}-grpc-stream`, WebSocket/GraphQL streams use
  `{correlationId}-ws-stream`.

### Inbound frame phase

- **Hold points:**
  - `BidirectionalWebSocketFrameHandler.channelRead0` — WebSocket bidirectional
    inbound frames (A1e). When enabled, each inbound WebSocket frame is copied to
    `byte[]`, the original `WebSocketFrame` is released, and the copy is parked
    in `StreamFrameBreakpointRegistry` with `direction=INBOUND`.
  - `GraphQLSubscriptionHandler.channelRead0` — GraphQL subscription inbound
    frames (A1e). The text content is copied to `byte[]` (UTF-8), the frame is
    released, and the copy is parked.
- **gRPC-bidi inbound:** `GrpcBidiStreamHandler.handleData` — gRPC bidirectional
  streaming inbound DATA frames. When enabled, the handler copies the DATA frame
  bytes to `byte[]` and releases the `Http2DataFrame` IMMEDIATELY (refunding the
  HTTP/2 flow-control window), then parks the byte copy in the registry. The
  existing pull-based model (`autoRead=false` + explicit `ctx.read()`) provides
  backpressure: withholding `ctx.read()` prevents the next DATA frame from being
  delivered. This decouples flow-control window refund (immediate) from
  backpressure (deferred), so other streams on the same connection are NOT stalled.
  `GrpcBidiRouterHandler` generates a per-stream inbound stream ID and passes it
  along with the `Configuration` to the handler constructor.
- **gRPC-bidi inbound over HTTP/3 (QUIC):** `Http3GrpcBidiStreamHandler.onData` — the
  HTTP/3 analogue of the HTTP/2 gRPC-bidi inbound path. The QUIC driver
  (`Http3MockServerHandler`) already copies each `Http3DataFrame` to a `byte[]` and
  releases the frame BEFORE calling `onData`, so the byte copy is parked with no
  `ByteBuf` retained and the QUIC flow-control window is never pinned by a held frame.
  Backpressure/ordering differs from HTTP/2: rather than withholding `ctx.read()`, the
  handler dispatches one inbound frame at a time and buffers any frames the client sends
  while one is held in a bounded in-handler queue (bounded by `maxRequestBodySize`, which
  the driver enforces before `onData`), draining them in sequence-number order on resume.
  `Http3MockServerHandler` resolves the `INBOUND_STREAM` matcher once at HEADERS time
  (default-off) and passes the stream ID + matched breakpoint clientId/id + `Configuration`
  + WS registry to the handler constructor.
- Decision actions: CONTINUE (process the original frame), MODIFY (process a
  replacement frame), DROP (discard — do not process), INJECT (process original
  + extra frame), CLOSE (evict stream, send CANCELLED trailer, close stream).
- **Backpressure:** WebSocket and GraphQL handlers use `autoRead=false` while
  a frame is parked. The gRPC-bidi handler uses its existing pull-based model
  (withholding `ctx.read()`) — no `autoRead` toggling needed since it is already
  `false` from `handlerAdded`. On resume (any decision), `ctx.read()` is called
  to request the next frame (or `finish()` is called if `endStream`).
- **ByteBuf discipline:** the original `WebSocketFrame`'s ByteBuf is copied to
  `byte[]` at park time and the frame is released immediately. Both WebSocket
  handlers use `super(false)` (no auto-release), so the handler manages release
  explicitly. For gRPC-bidi, the `Http2DataFrame` is released in a `finally`
  block immediately after byte copy — this refunds the HTTP/2 flow-control
  window before any breakpoint parking delay. On resume, WebSocket frames are
  reconstructed via `Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(byte[])` for matcher evaluation;
  gRPC frames are passed as `byte[]` to the decoder. No ByteBuf is retained
  across the breakpoint hold period.
- **Stream ID format:** WebSocket inbound streams use `{correlationId}-ws-inbound`;
  gRPC-bidi inbound streams use `grpc-bidi-inbound-{path}-{uuid}` over HTTP/2 and
  `grpc-bidi-inbound-{path}-h3-{uuid}` over HTTP/3 (QUIC).
- **Direction field:** `PausedStreamFrame.direction` is `INBOUND` for client-to-server
  frames and `OUTBOUND` (default) for server-to-client frames. The `direction` field
  is included in the `PausedStreamFrameDTO` dispatched over the callback WebSocket.
- **Channel close eviction:** `channelInactive` in all handlers (WebSocket,
  GraphQL, and gRPC-bidi over both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3) evicts all held inbound
  frames for the stream, preventing leaks and hanging futures.

## Safety rails

- **Timeout auto-continue:** each paused exchange or frame auto-continues if not
  resolved within `breakpointTimeoutMillis` (default 30 seconds).
- **Max-held cap:** when `breakpointMaxHeld` (default 50) exchanges/frames are
  held (request/response breakpoints and stream frames use separate registries
  but both check the same cap), new intercepts are skipped.
- **Default off:** breakpoints are inactive until a matcher is registered via
  `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher` — zero overhead until then.

## Breakpoint matcher registry

A breakpoint is active when at least one matcher is registered. Register a matcher by sending the request definition (identical in shape to an expectation request matcher) and the set of phases to intercept:

```
PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher
{
  "httpRequest": { "method": "GET", "path": "/api/.*" },
  "phases": ["REQUEST", "RESPONSE"]
}
```

Any forwarded/proxied request that matches `httpRequest` will be paused at the specified phases. Registrations persist until explicitly removed or until `/mockserver/reset` is called (which clears all matchers).

#### Conditional (Nth-hit / skip-count) breakpoints

An optional `skipCount` makes a breakpoint conditional: the matcher still **matches** on every hit but only **pauses** once it has been hit more than `skipCount` times. With `"skipCount": 2`, the breakpoint does NOT pause on hits 1 and 2 and DOES pause from hit 3 onward. Absent (or `0`/null) means pause every time — the legacy behaviour.

```
PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher
{
  "httpRequest": { "path": "/api/.*" },
  "phases": ["REQUEST"],
  "clientId": "my-ws-client-id",
  "skipCount": 2
}
```

The hit counter lives on `BreakpointMatcher` as an `AtomicLong` and is incremented exactly once per matching exchange/phase inside `BreakpointMatcherRegistry.findMatch` (via `BreakpointMatcher.shouldPause()`), so it is correct under concurrent matching on the data plane / event loop. The counter is **per-breakpoint** (each registered matcher has its own). First-match semantics are preserved: the first matcher to match a request owns the decision for that hit — if it is still inside its skip window, `findMatch` returns `null` (do not pause) rather than falling through to a later matcher. `skipCount` is validated as a non-negative integer at registration (400 otherwise); `0` is normalised to "no skip".

#### Response-content conditional breakpoints (RESPONSE phase)

Three optional fields gate a **RESPONSE-phase** breakpoint on the actual response about to be written, so you can break only on (for example) a 5xx status or a body that contains a particular substring/regex:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `responseStatusCodeMin` | inclusive lower bound of the response status code |
| `responseStatusCodeMax` | inclusive upper bound of the response status code |
| `responseBodyContains` | a regular expression searched (find semantics) within the response body |

```
PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher
{
  "httpRequest": { "path": "/api/.*" },
  "phases": ["RESPONSE"],
  "clientId": "my-ws-client-id",
  "responseStatusCodeMin": 500
}
```

When any of these are set, the breakpoint pauses only when the response satisfies **all** configured conditions (status code within `[min, max]` AND body matching the regex). When none are set, the breakpoint pauses regardless of response content (legacy behaviour). The conditions are evaluated only at the response phase — they are ignored for the REQUEST/RESPONSE_STREAM/INBOUND_STREAM phases (the response is not known at the request phase), so the request-only `findMatch` path is unchanged.

Evaluation happens in `BreakpointMatcherRegistry.findResponseMatch(request, response, RESPONSE)`, which is wired into every RESPONSE-phase hold point in `HttpActionHandler` (matched mock responses, expectation-matched forwards, unmatched proxy forwards, and the unmatched-404). A matcher whose response condition **fails** is treated as not applicable: `findResponseMatch` **falls through** to later matchers (unlike `skipCount`, which always matches and only defers pausing). The per-breakpoint skip counter is only advanced when the response condition is satisfied. The `responseBodyContains` regex is compiled once at registration; an invalid regex returns 400 at registration time (and the model constructor throws `IllegalArgumentException`).

### Matcher-registry endpoints

| Method | Path | Body | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| PUT | `/mockserver/breakpoint/matcher` | `{httpRequest, phases, clientId, skipCount?, responseStatusCodeMin?, responseStatusCodeMax?, responseBodyContains?}` | Register a matcher; returns `{id, phases, clientId, skipCount?, responseStatusCodeMin?, responseStatusCodeMax?, responseBodyContains?}` (optional fields echoed only when set) |
| GET/PUT | `/mockserver/breakpoint/matchers` | — | List all registered matchers: `{matchers:[{id,httpRequest,phases,clientId,skipCount?,responseStatusCodeMin?,responseStatusCodeMax?,responseBodyContains?}]}` (optional fields present only when set) |
| PUT | `/mockserver/breakpoint/matcher/remove` | `{id}` | Remove a matcher by id; returns `{status:"removed",id}` or 404 |
| PUT | `/mockserver/breakpoint/matcher/clear` | — | Remove all matchers; returns `{status:"cleared",count}` |

**Validation:** `httpRequest` and `phases` are required; `phases` must be non-empty and contain only `REQUEST`, `RESPONSE`, `RESPONSE_STREAM`, or `INBOUND_STREAM` — unknown values return 400. The optional `skipCount` must be a non-negative integer (400 otherwise). `responseStatusCodeMin`/`responseStatusCodeMax` must be integers and `min` must not exceed `max`; `responseBodyContains` must be a valid regular expression (400 otherwise). The registry is cleared on `/mockserver/reset`.

**Matching semantics:** the `httpRequest` body uses the same matcher fields as an expectation request matcher (`method`, `path`, `headers`, `queryStringParameters`, `body`, etc.). An exchange pauses at a phase if any registered matcher matches the request for that phase.

## WebSocket callback resolution (`clientId` required)

Breakpoint matchers require a `clientId` field that identifies the callback
WebSocket client (`/_mockserver_callback_websocket`) to dispatch matched
exchanges to for interactive resolution -- reusing the same
`WebSocketClientRegistry` dispatch primitives that the object-callback
(`forwardObject` / `responseObject`) feature uses. Registration without a
`clientId` returns 400.

### Registration

```
PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher
{
  "httpRequest": { "method": "GET", "path": "/api/.*" },
  "phases": ["REQUEST", "RESPONSE"],
  "clientId": "my-ws-client-id"
}
```

The list endpoint (`GET /mockserver/breakpoint/matchers`) includes `clientId`
in each entry.

### Resolution protocol

- **REQUEST phase:** the paused request is sent to the client over the callback
  WS (with `WebSocketCorrelationId`, `X-MockServer-BreakpointId`, and
  `X-MockServer-RequestTimestamp` headers). The client replies with either:
  - An `HttpRequest` — forward that request (MODIFY if different, CONTINUE if
    identical to the original).
  - An `HttpResponse` — ABORT (write that response to the downstream client,
    do not forward upstream).

- **RESPONSE phase:** the paused request+response are sent to the client (the
  request carries the same `WebSocketCorrelationId`, `X-MockServer-BreakpointId`,
  and `X-MockServer-RequestTimestamp` headers). The client replies with an
  `HttpResponse` — the server writes it to the downstream client
  (MODIFY/CONTINUE).

### Safety rails

- **Timeout auto-continue:** if the client does not reply within
  `breakpointTimeoutMillis`, the exchange auto-continues with the original
  request/response.
- **Max-held cap:** WS-callback dispatches share the `breakpointMaxHeld` cap
  across the WS-callback dispatchers (`BreakpointCallbackDispatcher` and
  `StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher`). When the cap is reached, new breakpoints are
  skipped.
- **Disconnect cleanup:** when a callback client disconnects, all its registered
  breakpoint matchers are removed and any in-flight dispatches are auto-completed
  to CONTINUE (no hung exchanges).

### Dispatcher

`BreakpointCallbackDispatcher` is the process-wide singleton that manages
WS-callback breakpoint dispatch for buffered REQUEST/RESPONSE phases. It tracks
in-flight dispatches per correlation id, schedules timeouts, and provides
`autoCompleteForClient(clientId)` for disconnect cleanup. It is called from the
hold-point gate sites in `HttpActionHandler` when the matched breakpoint has a
non-null `clientId`.

### Per-frame WS protocol (RESPONSE_STREAM / INBOUND_STREAM)

When a stream-frame breakpoint matcher has a non-null `clientId` and the
owning client's callback WebSocket is connected, each held frame is dispatched
over the WS for interactive resolution -- using the same
`/_mockserver_callback_websocket` endpoint as the buffered request/response
dispatch. This is the **frozen contract** that all language clients and the
dashboard UI implement.

`StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher` is the process-wide singleton that manages
per-frame WS dispatch. It mirrors `BreakpointCallbackDispatcher` with the same
safety rails (timeout auto-continue, max-held cap, disconnect cleanup) and
the same non-blocking, event-loop-safe dispatch pattern. The dispatcher is
stateless with respect to server identity: the per-server
`WebSocketClientRegistry` is passed as a parameter at each dispatch site
(obtained from `HttpState` at core sites, or from a channel
`AttributeKey<WebSocketClientRegistry>` at netty sites), so multiple
`HttpState`/server instances in the same JVM dispatch to their own clients.

The `clientId` is always present (required since Unit 7b).

#### Server-to-client: `PausedStreamFrameDTO`

Sent over the callback WS to the owning client when a frame is held. The
client inspects the frame and replies with a `StreamFrameDecisionDTO`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `correlationId` | String | Unique ID; client MUST echo in reply |
| `streamId` | String | Stream this frame belongs to |
| `sequenceNumber` | int | 0-based monotonic index within the stream |
| `direction` | String | `"INBOUND"` or `"OUTBOUND"` |
| `phase` | String | `"RESPONSE_STREAM"` or `"INBOUND_STREAM"` |
| `body` | String | Frame payload, Base64-encoded (RFC 4648 section 4) |
| `requestMethod` | String (nullable) | HTTP method of the original request |
| `requestPath` | String (nullable) | Path of the original request |
| `breakpointId` | String (nullable) | The id of the breakpoint matcher that matched this frame, enabling per-breakpoint handler routing on the client |
| `requestTimestamp` | Long (nullable) | Epoch-millis when MockServer first received the originating request. Enables sorting frames by original request time |

**Encoding:** the `body` is standard Base64 with no line breaks. Frames are
arbitrary bytes (gRPC length-prefixed, WebSocket text/binary, SSE/chunked).

**Breakpoint identification:** for REQUEST/RESPONSE phases (buffered), the
matched breakpoint id is conveyed via the `X-MockServer-BreakpointId` header
on the dispatched `HttpRequest`. For RESPONSE_STREAM/INBOUND_STREAM phases,
the matched breakpoint id is the `breakpointId` field in the
`PausedStreamFrameDTO`. Clients use this id to route each pushed item to the
handler of the specific breakpoint that matched, supporting multiple concurrent
breakpoints without handler overwriting.

**Request timestamp:** all dispatched items carry the epoch-millis timestamp of
when MockServer first received the originating request:

- For REQUEST/RESPONSE phases, the `X-MockServer-RequestTimestamp` header is set
  on the dispatched `HttpRequest` (alongside `WebSocketCorrelationId` and
  `X-MockServer-BreakpointId`). The value is the string representation of the
  `Long` timestamp.
- For RESPONSE_STREAM/INBOUND_STREAM phases, the `requestTimestamp` field in the
  `PausedStreamFrameDTO` carries the same value as a `Long`.

All phases of the same exchange share the same timestamp value, enabling the
dashboard (and other clients) to sort every phase of one exchange by original
request time rather than by arrival time. The dashboard sorts by
`requestTimestamp` first, falling back to the client-side `receivedAt` for
servers that do not yet send the header.

#### Client-to-server: `StreamFrameDecisionDTO`

The client's reply carrying the resolution decision.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `correlationId` | String | MUST match the `PausedStreamFrameDTO` |
| `action` | String | `"CONTINUE"`, `"MODIFY"`, `"DROP"`, `"INJECT"`, or `"CLOSE"` |
| `body` | String (nullable) | Base64-encoded replacement/injected bytes; required for `MODIFY` and `INJECT` |

**Action semantics:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `CONTINUE` | Write the original frame unchanged |
| `MODIFY` | Write the `body` bytes instead of the original |
| `DROP` | Discard the frame (do not write / do not process inbound) |
| `INJECT` | Write the original frame AND an additional frame with `body` bytes |
| `CLOSE` | End the stream (drop frame, send stream-end signal, evict remaining) |

#### Safety rails

- **Timeout auto-continue:** if the client does not reply within
  `breakpointTimeoutMillis`, the frame auto-continues with the original bytes.
- **Max-held cap:** WS stream-frame dispatches share the `breakpointMaxHeld`
  cap with all other breakpoint registries and dispatchers. When the cap is
  reached, new frames are written immediately (no breakpoint).
- **Disconnect cleanup:** when a callback client disconnects, all its in-flight
  stream-frame dispatches are auto-completed to CONTINUE via
  `StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher.autoCompleteForClient(clientId)`.
- **Frame ordering:** ordering is preserved by the existing backpressure
  mechanisms (streaming body `requestMore()`, `autoRead=false`, withhold
  `ctx.read()`). The next frame is not delivered until the current one resolves.
- **Event-loop safety:** the WS dispatch future's `thenAccept` callback is
  marshalled onto the channel's event loop via `ctx.channel().eventLoop().execute()`.
  No blocking occurs on the Netty event loop.

## Control-plane endpoints

All breakpoint resolution is done over the callback WebSocket. The REST
control-plane endpoints below are for matcher management only.

See the "Breakpoint matcher registry" section above for the matcher endpoints
(`/breakpoint/matcher`, `/breakpoint/matchers`, `/breakpoint/matcher/remove`,
`/breakpoint/matcher/clear`).

## Configuration properties

Breakpoint activation is driven by the matcher registry (see "Breakpoint matcher registry" below), not by global flags. The two remaining properties are safety rails only:

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `mockserver.breakpointTimeoutMillis` | `30000` | Auto-continue timeout in milliseconds (shared across all phases) |
| `mockserver.breakpointMaxHeld` | `50` | Max concurrent paused exchanges/frames (shared across all registries) |

## Client support

Seven language clients implement the breakpoint callback WebSocket protocol:

| Client | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Java | `MockServerClient.addBreakpoint(...)` with `BreakpointRequestHandler`, `BreakpointResponseHandler`, `BreakpointStreamFrameHandler` |
| Node | `mockserver-client` npm package — `addBreakpoint`/`addRequestBreakpoint`/`addRequestAndResponseBreakpoint` |
| Python | `mockserver-client` PyPI package — `add_breakpoint`/`add_request_breakpoint`/`add_request_and_response_breakpoint` |
| Ruby | `mockserver` gem — `add_breakpoint`/`add_request_breakpoint`/`add_request_and_response_breakpoint` |
| Go | `mockserver-client-go` — `AddRequestBreakpoint`/`AddRequestResponseBreakpoint`/`AddStreamBreakpoint` |
| .NET | `MockServerClient` NuGet — `AddRequestBreakpoint`/`AddRequestResponseBreakpoint`/`AddStreamBreakpoint` |
| Rust | `mockserver-client` crate — `add_request_breakpoint`/`add_request_response_breakpoint`/`add_stream_breakpoint` |

**PHP is intentionally not supported.** Breakpoints require a persistent callback WebSocket connection for resolution. PHP runtimes lack WebSocket client support, so there is no way for PHP to participate in interactive resolution.

The dashboard is also a full callback WebSocket client: it connects to `/_mockserver_callback_websocket`, receives a server-assigned `clientId`, and resolves paused items in the Breakpoints panel (Live Exchanges and Live Streams tabs).

## Key classes

### Breakpoint matcher registry
- `BreakpointMatcher` — a registered breakpoint: request matcher, phases, required `clientId`, optional `skipCount` (Nth-hit) with a per-matcher `AtomicLong` hit counter and `shouldPause()` decision, and optional response-content conditions (`responseStatusCodeMin`/`responseStatusCodeMax` range + `responseBodyContains` regex, compiled once at construction) evaluated via `responseConditionMatches(HttpResponse)` / `hasResponseCondition()`
- `BreakpointMatcherRegistry` — process-wide singleton registry of breakpoint matchers with `findMatch` (request-only, REQUEST/stream phases), `findResponseMatch(request, response, phase)` (RESPONSE phase, evaluates response-content conditions), `removeByClientId`
- `BreakpointPhase` — enum: REQUEST, RESPONSE, RESPONSE_STREAM, INBOUND_STREAM

### Request/response breakpoints
- `BreakpointCallbackDispatcher` — process-wide singleton for WS-callback breakpoint dispatch; dispatches to owning client via `WebSocketClientRegistry`, manages in-flight tracking, timeouts, and disconnect cleanup
- `BreakpointDecision` — CONTINUE / MODIFY (request or response) / ABORT resolution
- `WebSocketClientRegistry.unregisterClient` — on disconnect, calls `BreakpointMatcherRegistry.removeByClientId`, `BreakpointCallbackDispatcher.autoCompleteForClient`, and `StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher.autoCompleteForClient` to clean up the client's breakpoints and in-flight dispatches
- `HttpActionHandler.handleUnmatchedProxyForward` — request-phase breakpoint intercept
- `HttpActionHandler.writeForwardActionResponse` — response-phase breakpoint intercept (matched)
- `HttpActionHandler.executeUnmatchedForward` — response-phase breakpoint intercept (unmatched)
- `HttpActionHandler.attemptResponseBreakpoint` — helper for RESPONSE phase WS dispatch

### Stream frame breakpoints (WS-callback path)
- `StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher` — process-wide singleton for per-frame WS-callback dispatch; dispatches `PausedStreamFrameDTO` to owning client, receives `StreamFrameDecisionDTO` replies, manages in-flight tracking, timeouts, and disconnect cleanup
- `PausedStreamFrameDTO` — server-to-client WS message: correlationId, streamId, sequenceNumber, direction, phase, body (Base64), requestMethod, requestPath
- `StreamFrameDecisionDTO` — client-to-server WS reply: correlationId, action (CONTINUE/MODIFY/DROP/INJECT/CLOSE), optional body (Base64)
- `WebSocketClientRegistry.sendStreamFrameMessage` — sends a `PausedStreamFrameDTO` to a client
- `WebSocketClientRegistry.registerStreamFrameCallbackHandler` — registers a callback for `StreamFrameDecisionDTO` replies by correlationId

### Stream frame breakpoints
- `StreamFrameCallbackDispatcher` — process-wide singleton for per-frame WS-callback dispatch
- `StreamFrameDecision` — CONTINUE / MODIFY / DROP / INJECT / CLOSE resolution
- `StreamFrameBreakpointRegistry` — process-wide singleton managing per-stream sequence counters and stream eviction
- `NettyResponseWriter.writeStreamingResponse` — hold point for SSE/chunked streams (forwarded + mock)
- `GrpcStreamResponseActionHandler.scheduleMessages` — hold point for gRPC server-streaming mock responses
- `HttpWebSocketResponseActionHandler.scheduleMessages` — hold point for WebSocket eager/scripted messages
- `HttpWebSocketResponseActionHandler.installBidirectionalHandler` — hold point for WebSocket bidi responses
- `HttpWebSocketResponseActionHandler.installGraphQLSubscriptionHandler` — hold point for GraphQL subscription pushes

### Inbound frame breakpoints
- `BidirectionalWebSocketFrameHandler.channelRead0` — hold point for WebSocket bidi inbound frames
- `GraphQLSubscriptionHandler.channelRead0` — hold point for GraphQL subscription inbound frames
- `GrpcBidiStreamHandler.handleData` — hold point for gRPC bidi inbound DATA frames (HTTP/2)
- `GrpcBidiRouterHandler` — routes gRPC bidi streams to `GrpcBidiStreamHandler` (HTTP/2)
- `Http3GrpcBidiStreamHandler.onData` — hold point for gRPC bidi inbound DATA frames (HTTP/3/QUIC)
- `Http3MockServerHandler.tryBeginGrpcBidi` — resolves the `INBOUND_STREAM` matcher and wires it into `Http3GrpcBidiStreamHandler`
- Uses the same `StreamFrameBreakpointRegistry` with `direction=INBOUND`

## Behavioural notes

- **Response chaos-latency is not re-applied after manual resolution.** When a
  response breakpoint is resolved (CONTINUE, MODIFY, or ABORT), any configured
  response chaos-latency for the matched expectation is bypassed. The manual
  resolution supersedes automatic chaos injection because the user has already
  inspected and approved (or replaced) the response.
- **REQUEST phase reply semantics.** A WS client replying with an `HttpRequest`
  means MODIFY/CONTINUE (forward the replacement or original). Replying with an
  `HttpResponse` means ABORT (write that response directly, do not forward).
- **RESPONSE phase reply semantics.** A WS client replying with an `HttpResponse`
  means write that response to the downstream client (MODIFY/CONTINUE).

## Dashboard UI

The dashboard is a **real callback client**: it opens a WebSocket to
`/_mockserver_callback_websocket` (the same endpoint language clients use) and
reads its server-assigned `clientId` from the first `WebSocketClientIdDTO`
message. Browser WebSockets cannot set custom request headers, so the server
generates the `clientId` server-side when the `CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID_HEADER`
is absent on the upgrade request (already handled in
`CallbackWebSocketServerHandler.upgradeChannel`).

The Breakpoints panel has three tabs:

### Matchers tab

- A **matcher-builder form** to register a breakpoint matcher with method, path
  (regex), phase checkboxes (Request, Response, Response stream frames,
  Inbound stream frames), and an optional **Skip count** field (Nth-hit /
  conditional breakpoint). On submit, calls
  `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher {httpRequest, phases, clientId, skipCount?}`
  with the dashboard's assigned `clientId`.
- Lists all registered matchers (`GET /mockserver/breakpoint/matchers`) with
  remove and clear-all actions.

### Live Exchanges tab

- When a registered matcher triggers on a forwarded request or response, the
  server pushes the paused item over the callback WS (same `{type, value}`
  envelope as language clients). The dashboard shows it in real time.
- Resolution is interactive: **Continue** (send the original back), **Modify**
  (edit the JSON in a dialog, send modified), or **Abort** (REQUEST phase only;
  sends an `HttpResponse` with status 503 to skip forwarding).
- The WS reply IS the resolution -- no REST endpoint is called.

### Live Streams tab

- Paused stream frames (`PausedStreamFrameDTO`) are pushed over the same
  callback WS and shown in real time with direction, stream ID, sequence
  number, and Base64-decoded body preview.
- Resolution actions: **Continue**, **Modify** (edit body, Base64-encode),
  **Drop**, **Inject** (extra frame after the held one), **Close** (end the
  stream). Each sends a `StreamFrameDecisionDTO` back over the WS.

### Header-less callback registration

The `CallbackWebSocketServerHandler.upgradeChannel` method handles both
registration modes:

```java
final String clientId = httpRequest.headers().contains(CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID_HEADER)
    ? httpRequest.headers().get(CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID_HEADER)
    : UUIDService.getUUID();
```

Language clients supply the header; the dashboard (browser WebSocket) does not,
so the server generates a UUID. In both cases, `registerClient(clientId, ctx)`
sends a `WebSocketClientIdDTO{clientId}` to the client and registers the
channel. The dashboard reads its assigned `clientId` from that first message.

### Connection lifecycle

- The callback WS connection is opened when the Breakpoints panel mounts and
  closed on unmount. It auto-reconnects on close with exponential backoff.
- A connection-state indicator (green/yellow/red dot) shows the WS status.
- On disconnect, the server automatically removes the dashboard's breakpoint
  matchers and auto-continues any in-flight dispatches (same cleanup as any
  other callback client).

## Java client

### Matcher-driven WS-callback breakpoints

The Java client can register breakpoint matchers with callback handlers that are
invoked over the callback WebSocket (`/_mockserver_callback_websocket`). The
client opens a single WS connection (reused across all breakpoints), obtains a
`clientId`, and passes it to the server during matcher registration so paused
items are dispatched to the owning client.

#### Handler interfaces

Three handler interfaces cover all four breakpoint phases:

| Interface | Phase(s) | Input | Output |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| `BreakpointRequestHandler` | REQUEST | `HttpRequest` | `HttpRequest` (continue/modify) or `HttpResponse` (abort) |
| `BreakpointResponseHandler` | RESPONSE | `HttpRequest` + `HttpResponse` | `HttpResponse` (continue/modify) |
| `BreakpointStreamFrameHandler` | RESPONSE_STREAM, INBOUND_STREAM | `PausedStreamFrameDTO` | `StreamFrameDecisionDTO` |

All three are `@FunctionalInterface` and can be expressed as lambdas.

#### Registration API

```java
// Register with explicit phases and all handlers
String id = mockServerClient.addBreakpoint(
    request().withPath("/api/.*"),
    EnumSet.of(BreakpointPhase.REQUEST, BreakpointPhase.RESPONSE),
    request -> request,                          // REQUEST handler
    (request, response) -> response,             // RESPONSE handler
    null                                         // no stream-frame handler
);

// Convenience: REQUEST phase only
String id = mockServerClient.addBreakpoint(
    request().withPath("/api/.*"),
    request -> modifiedRequest                   // BreakpointRequestHandler
);

// Convenience: REQUEST + RESPONSE
String id = mockServerClient.addBreakpoint(
    request().withPath("/api/.*"),
    request -> request,                          // BreakpointRequestHandler
    (request, response) -> response              // BreakpointResponseHandler
);

// Convenience: streaming phases
String id = mockServerClient.addBreakpoint(
    request().withPath("/stream/.*"),
    EnumSet.of(BreakpointPhase.RESPONSE_STREAM),
    frame -> new StreamFrameDecisionDTO()        // BreakpointStreamFrameHandler
        .setCorrelationId(frame.getCorrelationId())
        .setAction("CONTINUE")
);
```

The returned `id` is the server-assigned breakpoint matcher id (UUID).

#### Matcher management

```java
String json = mockServerClient.listBreakpointMatchers();      // GET /breakpoint/matchers
mockServerClient.removeBreakpointMatcher(id);                  // PUT /breakpoint/matcher/remove
mockServerClient.clearBreakpointMatchers();                    // PUT /breakpoint/matcher/clear
```

#### WS connection lifecycle

- The breakpoint WS connection is opened lazily on the first `addBreakpoint` call.
- The same connection and `clientId` are reused for all subsequent breakpoint
  registrations from this `MockServerClient` instance.
- On `stop()` / `reset`, the WS connection is closed and the server automatically
  cleans up all matchers owned by that `clientId` and auto-continues any in-flight
  dispatches.
- If the WS connection drops, the server's disconnect cleanup removes the
  client's matchers and auto-continues held items.

#### Stream frame resolution

For RESPONSE_STREAM and INBOUND_STREAM phases, the `BreakpointStreamFrameHandler`
receives a `PausedStreamFrameDTO` (the frozen server-to-client contract from
Unit 3) and returns a `StreamFrameDecisionDTO`. The `correlationId` is
automatically echoed. The handler can return any of the five actions: CONTINUE,
MODIFY, DROP, INJECT, CLOSE. If the handler throws, the client auto-continues
the frame.
