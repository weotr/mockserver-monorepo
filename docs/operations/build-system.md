# Build System

## Monorepo Build Landscape

The monorepo contains multiple projects with different build tools:

| Directory | Build Tool | Build Command (from repo root) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `mockserver/` | Maven (`./mvnw`) | `cd mockserver && ./mvnw clean install` |
| `mockserver-ui/` | Vite + npm | `cd mockserver-ui && npm ci && npm run build` |
| `mockserver-node/` | Grunt + npm | `cd mockserver-node && npm ci && npx grunt` |
| `mockserver-client-node/` | npm + TypeScript | `cd mockserver-client-node && npm ci && npm test` |
| `mockserver-client-python/` | pip + pytest | `cd mockserver-client-python && pip install -e '.[dev]' && pytest` |
| `mockserver-client-ruby/` | Bundler + RSpec | `cd mockserver-client-ruby && bundle install && bundle exec rspec` |
| `mockserver/mockserver-maven-plugin/` | Maven | `cd mockserver && ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests && ./mvnw -f mockserver-maven-plugin/pom.xml clean verify` |
| `mockserver-performance-test/` | k6 (JavaScript) | `cd mockserver-performance-test && for f in k6/*.js; do k6 inspect "$f"; done` |

> **Running the regression and growth scripts locally:** see [Performance regression pipeline — local runs](#performance-regression-pipeline-local-runs) below.

CI builds are orchestrated by `.buildkite/scripts/generate-pipeline.sh` which selects pipelines based on changed files. See [CI/CD](../infrastructure/ci-cd.md) for details.

## Local Development Behind a Corporate TLS-Inspection Proxy

**TL;DR — if dependency downloads fail locally with TLS/`certificate verify failed`/`unable to get local issuer certificate` errors, your machine is behind a TLS-inspection proxy and the toolchains don't trust the corporate root CA. Point each toolchain at a *combined* CA bundle (system roots + corporate root). This is configured ONLY in your user/shell environment — never in repo files or pipeline scripts. CI agents have no proxy, so pipelines are unaffected and must stay that way.**

### Why this happens

A corporate TLS-inspection (MITM) proxy re-signs HTTPS traffic with a certificate chained to a corporate root CA. Package managers (npm, pip, cargo, composer, gem, go) and HTTP clients reject it because the corporate root is not in their default trust store. CI build agents run outside the proxy, so they never see this — which is exactly why the fix must live outside the repo.

### One-time setup (new laptop / new engineer)

1. Obtain the corporate root CA (PEM) from IT, e.g. `tesco_root_ca.pem`.
2. Build a **combined** bundle (system roots + corporate root) once and keep it at a stable path, e.g. `~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.tesco-ca
   # system roots from the OpenSSL/certifi default + the corporate root, concatenated:
   cat "$(python3 -m certifi 2>/dev/null || echo /etc/ssl/cert.pem)" ~/path/to/tesco_root_ca.pem \
     > ~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem
   ```
3. Add the per-toolchain settings below to your **shell profile** (`~/.zshrc`) and user configs. Nothing here is committed.

### Per-toolchain settings (user/shell scope only)

| Toolchain | Where it runs | Setting (local only) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Anything in Docker via `.buildkite/scripts/run-in-docker.sh` (PHP/Python/Ruby/Go/Rust/.NET/Node) | container | `export LOCAL_DOCKER_CA_BUNDLE=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` — the wrapper mounts it read-only and points every in-container tool at it (opt-in; unset in CI). |
| npm — direct **and** the `mockserver/mockserver-netty` Maven `build-ui` step (frontend-maven-plugin) | host | `~/.npmrc` with `cafile=/Users/<you>/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` (npm always reads user `~/.npmrc`, so the Maven plugin's bundled node picks it up too). |
| Node (direct scripts) | host | `export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` |
| Python / pip / requests | host | `export PIP_CERT=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` |
| Ruby / bundler / rubygems | host | `export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem BUNDLE_SSL_CA_CERT=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` |
| Rust / cargo | host | `export CARGO_HTTP_CAINFO=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` |
| Go (and git clone over HTTPS) | host | `export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem GIT_SSL_CAINFO=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` |
| AWS CLI / SDK / Terraform | host | `export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=~/.tesco-ca/ca-bundle-with-tesco.pem` (see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) → AWS Prerequisites) |

The Java/Maven build itself usually works because the JDK trust store already chains Maven Central correctly; if a JVM HTTPS download fails (e.g. the frontend-maven-plugin downloading node from nodejs.org on a *cold* build), import the corporate root into a JDK trust store and pass `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=...`, or pre-warm `mockserver-netty/target/frontend` once on a network without the proxy.

### Non-negotiable: keep proxy config out of the repo and pipelines

- **Never** add `cafile`/`strict-ssl`/proxy settings to a committed `.npmrc`, `pom.xml`, `pip.conf`, `Cargo` config, or any `.buildkite/scripts/**` step — that would break or skew CI, which has no proxy.
- The only repo-side hook is the **opt-in, env-gated** `LOCAL_DOCKER_CA_BUNDLE` branch in `run-in-docker.sh`: it does nothing unless the variable is set, and CI never sets it.
- All other settings live in your shell profile and user-level config files (`~/.npmrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

## Java Server Build (mockserver/)

### Maven Configuration

MockServer uses Maven 3.9.16 via the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`). The project targets Java 17 source/target compatibility — produced bytecode runs on Java 17+, and building from source requires JDK 17+.

`mockserver/.mvn/maven.config` sets `-T 1C` so the reactor builds with the parallel (one-thread-per-core) `MultiThreadedBuilder` by default, matching CI (`./mvnw -T 1C clean install`). This is a free speed-up on the multi-module compile/package phases and composes with the within-module parallel unit tests (see [performance-tuning.md](performance-tuning.md)). Pass `-T 1` on the command line to force a single-threaded build when debugging reactor ordering or interleaved log output.

### Modules

The project comprises 25 Maven modules:

| Module | Packaging | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `mockserver-bom` | pom (flattened) | Bill of Materials — import to pin every MockServer module and third-party transitive to one converged version |
| `mockserver-testing` | jar | Shared test utilities |
| `mockserver-client-java` | jar | Java client API (`MockServerClient`) |
| `mockserver-client-java-no-dependencies` | jar (shaded) | Client with all dependencies shaded |
| `mockserver-core` | jar | Domain model, matching, TLS, templates, codecs, event log, action handlers |
| `mockserver-integration-testing` | jar | Integration test base classes |
| `mockserver-integration-testing-no-dependencies` | jar (shaded) | Integration test base classes, shaded |
| `mockserver-war` | war | Servlet WAR deployment |
| `mockserver-proxy-war` | war | Proxy-only WAR deployment |
| `mockserver-netty` | jar (+fat, shaded) | Netty server, CLI, dashboard, proxy relay |
| `mockserver-netty-no-dependencies` | jar (shaded) | Netty server with all dependencies shaded |
| `mockserver-junit-rule` | jar | JUnit 4 `@Rule` integration |
| `mockserver-junit-rule-no-dependencies` | jar (shaded) | JUnit 4 rule, shaded |
| `mockserver-junit-jupiter` | jar | JUnit 5 `@ExtendWith` integration |
| `mockserver-junit-jupiter-no-dependencies` | jar (shaded) | JUnit 5 extension, shaded |
| `mockserver-spring-test-listener` | jar | Spring Test integration |
| `mockserver-spring-test-listener-no-dependencies` | jar (shaded) | Spring Test integration, shaded |
| `mockserver-examples` (at `../examples/java`) | jar | Usage examples |
| `mockserver-async` | jar | AsyncAPI broker mocking |
| `mockserver-testcontainers` | jar | Testcontainers integration module |
| `mockserver-state-infinispan` | jar | Infinispan-backed clustered state backend |
| `mockserver-blob-s3` | jar | S3 blob storage backend |
| `mockserver-blob-gcs` | jar | GCS blob storage backend |
| `mockserver-blob-azure` | jar | Azure blob storage backend |
| `mockserver-k8s-webhook` | jar (+fat) | Kubernetes admission webhook for sidecar injection |

### Dependency management and the BOM

MockServer pins all of its third-party transitive versions in the **parent POM's `<dependencyManagement>`**, and the reactor's own Enforcer `dependencyConvergence` rule guards that everything resolves to a single version. That management is, by design, **not inherited by downstream consumers** — so a consumer running the same Enforcer rule would see MockServer's transitive versions diverge.

`mockserver-bom` closes that gap. It extends the parent POM (inheriting every third-party pin) and adds `dependencyManagement` entries for the published MockServer modules, then uses the `flatten-maven-plugin` (`flattenMode=bom`, `dependencyManagement=expand`) to publish a **self-contained** POM with all pins inlined and no parent reference. Consumers import it to get a converged tree:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.mock-server</groupId>
      <artifactId>mockserver-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${mockserver.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Two related choices reduce convergence pressure even without the BOM: `mockserver-client-java` **excludes the server-only engines** from its `mockserver-core` dependency (a client never executes templates/scripts/WASM/gRPC), and `mockserver-core` **prunes the stale `velocity-engine-core 2.3`** that `velocity-tools-generic` drags in alongside the `2.4.1` the build already uses. The parent's `flatten-maven-plugin` execution is declared `<inherited>false</inherited>`, so it applies only to the root POM; `mockserver-bom` carries its own copy.

### Quick Reference

All Maven commands run from within the `mockserver/` directory:

```bash
cd mockserver

# Full build (clean + compile + test + package)
./mvnw clean install

# Build without tests
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests

# Build a single module
./mvnw clean install -pl mockserver-core

# Run unit tests only
./mvnw test -pl mockserver-netty

# Run integration tests
./mvnw verify -pl mockserver-netty
```

## Build Plugins

| Plugin | Version | Phase | Purpose |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| `maven-compiler-plugin` | 3.15.0 | compile | Java 17 compilation with `-Xlint:all` |
| `git-commit-id-maven-plugin` | 9.0.1 | initialize | Resolves the abbreviated git commit hash into `${git.commit.id.abbrev}` for the version class (mockserver-core only); degrades to an empty hash when no git metadata is present |
| `templating-maven-plugin` | 3.1.0 | generate-sources | Generates version class from templates (version, group/artifact id, git hash) |
| `maven-jar-plugin` | 3.5.0 | package | JAR packaging with MANIFEST.MF metadata |
| `maven-clean-plugin` | 3.5.0 | clean | Removes `.log`, keystore, and temp files |
| `maven-surefire-plugin` | 3.5.6 | test | Unit tests (`*Test.java`, excludes `*IntegrationTest.java`) |
| `maven-failsafe-plugin` | 3.5.6 | integration-test | Integration tests (`*IntegrationTest.java`) |
| `maven-checkstyle-plugin` | 3.6.0 | validate | Code style enforcement via `checkstyle.xml` |
| `maven-enforcer-plugin` | 3.6.3 | validate | Dependency convergence checks |
| `exec-maven-plugin` | 3.6.3 | clean | Runs `stop_MockServer.sh` (Unix profile) |

## Test Configuration

- **Unit tests:** `*Test.java` — run during `test` phase via Surefire
- **Integration tests:** `*IntegrationTest.java` — run during `integration-test`/`verify` phases via Failsafe
- **Parallel unit tests (`mockserver-core`):** Surefire runs in two phases — a parallel phase (`parallel=classes`, `threadCount=4`) for the bulk of the suite, and a `sequential-tests` execution (`parallel=none`) for the classes that mutate JVM-global state (`ConfigurationProperties` system properties, the static Prometheus `Metrics` registry, the controllable clock, or globally-fixed time). `ParallelStaticStateGuardTest` fails the build if the parallel-excluded and sequential-included class lists drift apart. See [performance-tuning.md](performance-tuning.md) for the rationale.
- **Log level:** `mockserver.logLevel=ERROR` during tests
- **Locale:** Forced to `en-GB` (`-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=GB`)
- **Test listener:** `org.mockserver.test.PrintOutCurrentTestRunListener` for progress output

## Packaging Outputs

The `mockserver-netty` module produces multiple artifacts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    MN[mockserver-netty]
    MN --> JAR[Standard JAR]
    MN --> FAT["jar-with-dependencies
Fat JAR with all deps"]
    MN --> SHADED["Shaded JAR
Relocated packages"]
    MN --> BREW["brew-tar
Homebrew tarball"]
    MN --> DEB["Debian Package
.deb with init.d"]
```

| Artifact | Classifier | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Standard JAR | (none) | Module classes only |
| Fat JAR | `jar-with-dependencies` | All dependencies bundled (used by Docker) |
| Shaded JAR | `shaded` | Dependencies relocated to avoid conflicts |
| Homebrew tarball | `brew-tar` | Tarball for Homebrew formula |
| Debian package | (none) | `.deb` with SysV init.d and Upstart configs |

## Distribution

Artifacts are published to:

- **Central Portal** (snapshots): `https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/`
- **Maven Central** (releases): via Central Portal at `https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-releases/`

GPG signing is required for releases (configured in the `release` profile).

## Performance regression pipeline — local runs

`mockserver-performance-test/k6/regression.js` and `growth.js` can be run locally against the compose stack in `mockserver-performance-test/stack/`. The `forward` behaviour requires a dedicated upstream MockServer because it proxies to a separate instance (not itself). Use `K6_FORWARD_SELF=true` to skip the upstream requirement on a single-container local smoke run.

```bash
# Start the compose stack (includes mockserver + mockserver-upstream)
cd mockserver-performance-test/stack
docker compose up -d

# Run regression over HTTP (default)
k6 run \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:1080 \
  -e K6_RESULT_PATH=/tmp/perf-result.json \
  mockserver-performance-test/k6/regression.js

# Run regression over HTTPS + HTTP/2
k6 run \
  -e BASE_URL=https://localhost:1080 \
  -e PROTO=https_h2 \
  -e K6_RESULT_PATH=/tmp/perf-result-h2.json \
  mockserver-performance-test/k6/regression.js

# Run growth (fills maxLogEntries, measures latency slope)
k6 run \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:1080 \
  mockserver-performance-test/k6/growth.js

# Single-container smoke (no upstream needed)
k6 run \
  -e K6_FORWARD_SELF=true \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:1080 \
  mockserver-performance-test/k6/regression.js
```

The upstream container is named `mockserver-upstream` and listens on port 1080 inside the stack network (`FORWARD_UPSTREAM_HOST` defaults to `mockserver-upstream:1080`). For local runs where k6 is on the host, set `FORWARD_UPSTREAM_HOST=localhost:<exposed-port>` or use `K6_FORWARD_SELF=true`.

### Result JSON schema

The pipeline compare step (`perf-test-compare.sh`) merges two artifacts and persists the result to S3. The schemas are:

**`perf-result.json`**
```json
{
  "metadata": { "sha": "...", "branch": "...", "timestamp": "..." },
  "behaviours": {
    "<op>_<proto>": { "p50_ms": 0, "p95_ms": 0, "p99_ms": 0, "throughput_rps": 0, "error_rate": 0 }
  },
  "growth": {
    "cpu_peak": 0, "heap_start": 0, "heap_end": 0, "heap_peak": 0, "heap_ratio": 0,
    "gc_seconds_delta": 0, "threads_peak": 0, "p95_start": 0, "p95_end": 0, "p95_ratio": 0
  }
}
```

**`perf-microbench.json`**
```json
{
  "microbench": {
    "<matcherType>_<count>": { "time_per_op": 0, "time_unit": "ns/op", "alloc_bytes_per_op": 0 }
  }
}
```

`<op>_<proto>` keys are `match_http`, `forward_http`, `template_http`, `large_http`, and their `_https_h2` counterparts. The merged run is stored at `s3://mockserver-ci-perf-results/runs/<branch>/<iso>__<sha>.json`.
