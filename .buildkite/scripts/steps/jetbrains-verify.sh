# Runs the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier against the recommended IDE set (configured in
# mockserver-jetbrains/build.gradle.kts -> intellijPlatform.pluginVerification). This
# catches internal/deprecated/incompatible IntelliJ Platform API usages before a
# Marketplace upload is rejected. The verifier downloads several IDEs from the
# JetBrains CDN, so this is slower than the unit-test step and gets its own timeout.
#
# Same containerisation rationale as jetbrains-test.sh: runs as root in a plain JDK 17
# image (the Gradle wrapper provides Gradle 9.5.1 for the IntelliJ Platform plugin
# 2.16), and builds inside an in-container copy under /tmp so root-owned Gradle output
# (build/, .gradle/, .kotlin/, .intellijPlatform/) never lands in the mounted
# workspace and breaks the next build's git checkout/clean.
#
# After verification (pass OR fail) the per-IDE verifier report is copied back into the
# mounted workspace at mockserver-jetbrains/build/reports/pluginVerifier so the pipeline
# step's artifact_paths can upload it for diagnosis. The copied tree is chmod'd
# world-writable so the (non-root) agent can git-clean it on the next checkout despite
# being created by root. The verifier's exit code is preserved so a real finding still
# reddens the build.
