# master actually moved since the last successful perf build (requirement: "once
# per day IF there has been a commit since the last run"). Buildkite `if:`
# expressions can't read runtime state, so this guard decides at runtime and
# dynamically uploads the run/micro-benchmark/compare steps ONLY when there is a
# new commit — the same dynamic-pipeline pattern as generate-pipeline.sh.
#
# Runs on the cheap `trigger` queue (just an API query + git diff).

# --- OPT-IN: load-injection ceiling + scaling sweep ---------------------------
# The injection step (perf-test-inject.sh) is heavy (multi-instance compose +
# Envoy + a per-N scale sweep, ~60m) and answers a DIFFERENT question from the
# daily regression run — "how much load can MockServer GENERATE", not "how fast
# does it SERVE". So it is NOT part of the standard daily dispatch. It runs only
# when explicitly requested: the `PERF_INJECT` build env is truthy, or the build
# message carries the `[perf-inject]` marker. This keeps the daily commit-gated
# build lean while making the injection sweep one toggle away — and because it is
# independent of the new-commit guard, it can be re-run on the SAME commit.
