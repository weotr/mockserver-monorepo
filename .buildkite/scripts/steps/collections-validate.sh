# Regenerates the Postman + Bruno API collections from the OpenAPI spec and fails
# if the committed collections are out of date. The OpenAPI spec is the single
# source of truth (scripts/collections/generate_collections.py) — this gate keeps
# examples/postman/** and examples/bruno/** in lock-step with it, so a spec change
# that forgets to regenerate cannot merge.
#
# The drift check is git-independent (plain `diff -r` against a snapshot taken
# before regeneration) so it works the same whether CI checks out a full clone or
# a git worktree (whose .git metadata lives outside the mounted directory).
