# Publish mockserver-testcontainers (PHP) to Packagist via a dedicated
# subtree-split mirror repo. Mirrors client-php.sh exactly.
#
# Packagist requires composer.json at the REPOSITORY ROOT of the default branch
# and does NOT support subdirectory packages. Because this module lives at
# mockserver-testcontainers/php/ inside the monorepo, it is published through a
# read-only mirror repo whose root IS the package:
#
#   github.com/mock-server/mockserver-testcontainers-php   (master = subtree
#                                                            split of
#                                                            mockserver-testcontainers/php/)
#
# The monorepo stays the single source of truth — this step regenerates the
# mirror from it at release time. Packagist has a webhook on the MIRROR repo, so
# pushing master + a version tag there triggers indexing within 1-2 minutes.
#
# ONE-TIME SETUP (see mockserver-testcontainers/php/PUBLISHING.md): create the
# public mirror repo, submit it on Packagist, and add the Packagist webhook to
# the MIRROR repo (not this one). Until the mirror repo exists this component
# skips gracefully (exit 0) — a soft_fail channel must never block the release
# because its target repo isn't provisioned yet.
#
# FAILURE POLICY (mirrors client-php.sh — no silent error-swallowing):
#   - The mirror repo not being reachable is a documented "not-yet-provisioned"
#     state, so it graceful-skips (exit 0). Every OTHER failure is HARD.
#   - The git operations (subtree split + push mirror master + push tag) ARE the
#     publish. Each push is wrapped in `retry` and HARD-fails if it ultimately
#     fails.
#   - The `git subtree split` runs INSIDE the pinned Maven container, because the
#     release-agent host git lacks the git-subtree subcommand. The container
#     writes the split commit to a temp branch in the SHARED, bind-mounted .git;
#     the host then resolves that branch's sha and PUSHES it (the host holds the
#     mirror push credential via configure_git_for_push's http.extraheader).
#   - A missing or invalid composer.json is a real prerequisite failure and
#     HARD-fails.
#   - Packagist *indexing* is webhook-driven and genuinely lags, so that — and
#     only that — is retry-then-tolerate with a :warning:.
#
# Dry-run: validate composer.json, skip the split + push.
