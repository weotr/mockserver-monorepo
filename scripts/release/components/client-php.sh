# Publish mockserver-client-php to Packagist via a dedicated split-repo mirror.
#
# Packagist requires composer.json at the REPOSITORY ROOT of the default branch
# and does NOT support subdirectory packages. Because the PHP client lives at
# mockserver-client-php/ inside this monorepo, it is published through a
# read-only mirror repo whose root IS the package:
#
#   github.com/mock-server/mockserver-client-php   (master = subtree split of
#                                                    mockserver-client-php/)
#
# The monorepo stays the single source of truth — this step regenerates the
# mirror from it at release time. Packagist has a webhook on the MIRROR repo, so
# pushing master + a version tag there triggers indexing within 1-2 minutes.
#
# NOTE: one-time setup (already done): create the public mirror repo, submit it
# on Packagist, and add the Packagist webhook to the MIRROR repo (not this one).
#
# FAILURE POLICY (no silent error-swallowing):
#   - The git operations (subtree split + push mirror master + push tag) ARE the
#     publish. Each push is wrapped in `retry` to ride out transient git/network
#     errors and HARD-fails the step if it ultimately fails.
#   - The `git subtree split` runs INSIDE the pinned Maven container, because the
#     release-agent host git lacks the git-subtree subcommand (release build #51
#     died with `git: 'subtree' is not a git command`). The container writes the
#     split commit to a temp branch in the SHARED, bind-mounted .git; the host
#     then resolves that branch's sha and PUSHES it (the host — not a container —
#     holds the mirror push credentials via `git config http.extraheader`). The
#     Maven image (already pinned in _lib.sh) ships git-subtree at
#     /usr/lib/git-core/git-subtree, so `git subtree` works with no apt install.
#   - A missing or invalid composer.json is a real prerequisite failure and now
#     HARD-fails (it used to silent-skip).
#   - Packagist *indexing* (the package appearing on packagist.org) is
#     webhook-driven and genuinely lags, so that — and only that — is
#     retry-then-tolerate with a :warning: (the mirror push, i.e. the real
#     publish, has already succeeded).
#
# Dry-run: validate composer.json, skip the split + push.
