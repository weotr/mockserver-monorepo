#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Publish the MockServer MCP server manifest (server.json) to the official MCP
# registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io).
#
# Namespace: com.mock-server/mockserver — a DNS-verified namespace derived from
# the mock-server.com domain we own. Authentication is fully non-interactive
# (an ed25519 private key in Secrets Manager + a one-time DNS TXT record), so
# unlike the old io.github.mock-server/* namespace (interactive GitHub OAuth)
# this can run hands-off in Buildkite.
#
# FAILURE POLICY (no silent error-swallowing):
#   - Downloading + verifying the mcp-publisher CLI, the DNS login, and the
#     publish ARE the real actions. Network ops are wrapped in `retry` and
#     HARD-fail on a genuine error.
#   - The download checksum is a SECURITY control: when MCP_PUBLISHER_SHA256 is
#     set, a mismatch HARD-fails (never tolerated). Pin it on the agent to make
#     the verification mandatory; if unset, the gap is surfaced with a :warning:
#     (not silently skipped).
#   - The DNS key secret (mockserver-release/mcp-dns-key) EXISTS — a missing key
#     or a login/auth failure is a real misconfiguration and HARD-fails.
#   - KNOWN ordering dependency: the registry verifies that the referenced
#     Docker Hub image carries the ownership label, and that image is published
#     by an earlier step. If the image is not yet visible the publish fails with
#     a recognisable "image/label not found" error — that specific case is
#     eventually-consistent, so it is retry-then-tolerate with a :warning:. Any
#     OTHER publish error (auth, schema, registry 5xx after retries) HARD-fails.
#
# Dry-run: validate the committed server.json only; never mutate it; skip
# auth + publish.
