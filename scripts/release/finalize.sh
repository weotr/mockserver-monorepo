# ---- Idempotent re-run guard -----------------------------------------------
# A prior finalize (e.g. an earlier post-maven build) may have already bumped the
# committed pom to NEXT_VERSION, deployed the SNAPSHOT and pushed. The commit is
# the LAST step here (after `mvn deploy`), so a pom at NEXT_VERSION on master
# means the deploy already succeeded. Without this guard, a re-run calls
# update_pom_versions looking for <version>RELEASE_VERSION</version>, finds none,
# and hard-fails ("no pom.xml contained <version>X</version>"). Detect the
# already-finalized state (no RELEASE_VERSION left, NEXT_VERSION present) and
# treat it as success.
#
# Safety notes:
#  - sync_to_origin_master above has reset local disk to origin/master, so the
#    guard reads COMMITTED master state, not transient local edits. A partial run
#    that deployed but died before the push leaves RELEASE_VERSION on master, so
#    the guard does NOT fire and the re-run correctly redoes the work.
#  - poms_contain_version is a whole-file substring match for the exact tag
#    <version>X</version>, mirroring update_pom_versions. It is NOT scoped to the
#    <project><version> element, so it would false-positive if some pom ever
#    carried NEXT_VERSION in a <dependency>/<plugin> block before finalize ran.
#    No repo pom does today (the reactor poms only ever reference the in-tree
#    version as the project version); revisit this guard if that changes.
