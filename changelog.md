# Changelog
All notable and significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`generateFromRecording` in `TEMPLATIZED` mode now reproduces the recorded traffic mix.** Each generated
  step's `weight` is set to the route's observed hit count and the scenario uses `stepSelection: WEIGHTED`,
  so replaying picks routes in proportion to how often they appeared in the recording (instead of plain
  ordered steps). `VERBATIM` mode is unchanged.

### Added

- **Anonymous, cookieless dashboard usage analytics via self-hosted PostHog.** The dashboard can report coarse, enumerated usage events (`app_open`, `view_change`, `feature_used`, `error_shown`) to a self-hosted PostHog instance. No request URLs, hostnames, headers, bodies, or expectation data are ever sent. Inactive by default until an operator supplies `dashboardAnalyticsEndpoint` and `dashboardAnalyticsKey`; disable globally with `dashboardAnalyticsEnabled=false`. Respects Do Not Track, Global Privacy Control, and a per-browser opt-out banner.
- **All client libraries now expose the full load-scenario surface.** The Java, Node, Python, Ruby, Go,
  .NET, PHP, and Rust clients gained the new scenario fields (`thresholds`, `abortOnFail`, `abortGraceMillis`,
  `pacing`, `feeder`, `stepSelection`, per-step `captures`/`weight`, profile `shape`), the new run-status
  fields (`p999Millis`, `droppedIterations`, `verdict`, `abortedByThreshold`, `thresholdResults`), and three
  new methods — `getLoadScenarioReport` (with optional `junit` format), `generateLoadScenarioFromOpenAPI`,
  and `generateLoadScenarioFromRecording`.
- **Mustache response templates can now read scenario state by name.** Velocity
  (`$scenario.get('orderId')`) and JavaScript (`scenario.get('orderId')`) could already read
  scenario/captured state in a response template; the Mustache engine now exposes the same through a
  section lambda — `{{#scenario.get}}orderId{{/scenario.get}}`, where the state name is the section
  body (jmustache cannot pass a method argument inline the way Velocity and JavaScript can). This
  completes `capture` → template value reuse across all three template engines, so an id captured
  from one request can be returned in the response body of a later request regardless of template
  engine. Documented on the Stateful Scenarios page with a per-engine example.
- **Validate recorded traffic against an OpenAPI spec** (`PUT /mockserver/trafficValidate`). A new
  control-plane endpoint validates the request/response traffic MockServer has already recorded against a
  provided OpenAPI spec (URL, file path, or inline), returning a structured pass/fail report
  (`totalRequests` / `passed` / `failed` / `allPassed` plus per-request `matchedOperation`, `requestErrors`,
  and `responseErrors`) — mirroring the `/contractTest` report. The endpoint is gated by the same
  control-plane authentication as its siblings, and a spec URL is fetched only after passing the same SSRF
  policy enforced on proxy/forward paths.
- **Java client helpers for contract testing & Pact.** The Java `MockServerClient` now exposes fluent, typed
  methods for the contract-testing endpoints: `contractTest(spec, baseUrl[, operationId])`,
  `trafficValidate(spec)`, `pactImport(json)`, `pactExport(consumer, provider)`, and `pactVerify(json)`. The
  contract-test and traffic-validation reports parse into typed `ContractReport` / `ContractResult` objects so
  callers no longer hand-roll raw HTTP.
- **Chaos experiments can assert an SLO and emit a verdict.** A chaos experiment may now carry an optional
  `sloCriteria`; on termination MockServer attaches a terminal `experimentVerdict` (`PASS` / `FAIL` /
  `INCONCLUSIVE`) evaluated strictly over the experiment's window — `PASS` only if every objective held
  throughout, `FAIL` on any breach or auto-halt, `INCONCLUSIVE` below the minimum sample count. Turns
  "inject faults" into "verify resilience held."
- **SLO-breach auto-halt for chaos experiments.** An experiment carrying `sloCriteria` is halted immediately
  (status `halted_by_slo_breach`, verdict `FAIL`) when an SLO objective is breached mid-run. No behaviour
  change when `sloCriteria` is absent. The dashboard's chaos panel now shows the terminal `experimentVerdict`
  (PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE) with per-objective observed-vs-threshold detail.
- **Closest-match hint on unmatched requests** (`closestMatchHintEnabled`, default **on**). When a request
  matches no expectation, the `404` response now carries a compact, length-bounded
  `x-mockserver-closest-match-hint` header naming the closest expectation and the first field that differed —
  answering "why didn't my mock match?" without enabling verbose diagnostics. Set `closestMatchHintEnabled=false`
  to suppress. (The opt-in `attachMismatchDiagnosticToResponse`, which adds a full JSON diagnostic body, is
  unchanged and still off by default.)
- **Standard OTLP endpoint fallback.** When `mockserver.otelEndpoint` / `MOCKSERVER_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is unset,
  MockServer now falls back to the OpenTelemetry-standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable.
- **Dashboard remembers where you were.** The active view and per-panel search/filter terms persist across
  reloads, and the view is reflected in the URL hash (e.g. `#/contract`) so views are linkable. A first visit
  still opens Get Started.
- **Dashboard search-operator hints.** The search box now advertises its operators (`status:>=400`,
  `method:POST`, `path:/api/*`, `/regex/`) via the placeholder and an accessible help tooltip.
- **Fluent `when().respond()` DSL in the Node client.** The Node client now offers a chainable
  `when(request).respond(response)` — plus `.forward()`, `.error()`, `.callback()`, and
  `.withTimes()` / `.withTimeToLive()` / `.withPriority()` builders — mirroring the Java client, alongside the
  existing procedural methods (which are unchanged).
- **SLO verification dashboard panel.** A new dashboard view authors service-level objectives (latency
  p50/p95/p99, error-rate) and runs them against the existing `/mockserver/verifySLO` endpoint, showing
  observed-vs-threshold per objective and an overall PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE verdict.
- **Opt-in per-test reset for the JUnit 5 extension.** `@MockServerSettings(resetBeforeEach = true)` resets the
  shared MockServer before each test (matching the JUnit 4 rule and Spring listener). Default off, so existing
  behaviour is unchanged.
- **Contract testing & Pact consumer guide.** New documentation page covering the `/contractTest` endpoint and
  Pact import / export / verify, with verified response codes.
- **Per-import realistic example generation.** OpenAPI imports can now request realistic (Datafaker) example
  values for a single import via a `"realisticValues": true` entry in the reserved `__generationOptions__`
  map (alongside the existing `seed` and `fieldOverrides` options), without changing the global
  `generateRealisticExampleValues` configuration. When the entry is absent, behaviour is unchanged and the
  global default still applies.

### Changed

- **Docker images cap the JVM heap at 75% of the container memory limit** (`-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0`, in
  every published image that runs the server — standard, snapshot, root, root-snapshot, graaljs, local, and
  clustered), making memory use predictable and avoiding OOM-kills that looked
  like hangs. Always run with an explicit container memory limit. To set a fixed heap, pass an explicit `-Xmx`
  (a second `MaxRAMPercentage` via `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` has no effect — it is applied before the image's flag).
  A build-time guard (`.buildkite/scripts/steps/docker-validate-sync.sh`) now fails the build if any
  server image's entrypoint is missing the cap, so it cannot drift back out of one variant.
  The Helm chart now ships commented `resources` and `app.jvmOptions` examples.
- **Generated TLS certificate validity extended to 10 years** (was 365 days) for the dynamically generated CA,
  leaf/server, and HTTP/3 self-signed certificates, so pinned-CA test setups no longer expire after a year.
- **Dashboard navigation reorganised into grouped menus.** The dashboard's views are now organised into six
  groups (Mock / Observe / Verify / Resilience / AI / Inspect) with submenus, replacing the flat overflow tab
  bar, so features are easier to discover.
- **Expectation matching scales to large expectation sets.** A candidate index buckets literal
  `(method, exact-path)` expectations so a request evaluates only plausible candidates instead of scanning
  every expectation; non-literal matchers (regex/notted/optional/schema/path-param) are always checked, so
  matching is byte-for-byte unchanged. The index engages automatically only above a size threshold (default
  64, overridable via `-Dmockserver.candidateIndexThreshold`); small expectation sets run the unchanged
  linear scan, so there is no regression at small scale and a large speed-up at thousands of expectations.

### Fixed

- **OpenAPI `format: date`/`date-time` examples render as ISO strings again** ([#2370](https://github.com/mock-server/mockserver-monorepo/issues/2370)).
  An inline `example: '2021-01-30'` on a `type: string, format: date` property was serialised in generated
  responses as epoch-millis (`1611964800000`) instead of the ISO string, because swagger-parser deserialises
  the example into a `java.util.Date` that the explicit-example path handed straight to Jackson. Date/date-time
  examples are now normalised back to their schema string form before serialisation (regression since 6.0.0).
- **Spring `@MockServerTest` works with JUnit 5 `@Nested` classes again** ([#2371](https://github.com/mock-server/mockserver-monorepo/issues/2371)).
  Injecting the `MockServerClient` declared on an outer test class into a `@Nested` inner test instance threw
  `IllegalArgumentException` because the field was set on the inner instance rather than the enclosing instance
  that declares it. Injection now resolves the correct enclosing instance via the synthetic outer reference
  (regression since 6.0.0).
- **Dashboard LLM pricing corrected.** The dashboard cost estimates were ~1 year stale and up to ~3× too high
  (e.g. Opus 4.8 shown at 15/75 instead of 5/25); the table is now synced to the server's pricing and guarded
  by a drift test.
- **SSL/decoder faults in the proxy/relay handlers are now logged at WARN** instead of being silently dropped,
  so genuine TLS/decoder problems are visible without the noise of benign connection closes.
- **LLM streaming pacing above 1000 tokens/sec is preserved.** Sub-millisecond per-token delays were
  integer-truncated to 0 ms (flattening fast streams); pacing now accumulates with fractional carry so
  cumulative timing stays accurate.
- **Forward DNS resolution moved off the calling thread.** Forward actions hand the connect path an unresolved
  address so DNS runs on the Netty event loop; SSRF validation still resolves and rejects private/loopback
  targets first, and a missing SSRF guard was added to the forward-validate path.
- **`mockserver-core` no longer triggers dependency-convergence errors in downstream builds**
  ([#1970](https://github.com/mock-server/mockserver-monorepo/issues/1970)). Projects that depend on
  `mockserver-core` and run `maven-enforcer`'s `dependencyConvergence` rule saw conflicts for guava, jsr305,
  rhino, libphonenumber, snakeyaml, commons-*, slf4j-api, jackson-* and jakarta.xml.bind-api, because those
  versions are pinned in MockServer's parent `dependencyManagement` (which is not transitive) while
  swagger-parser, json-patch, velocity and protobuf-java-util dragged in older transitive copies. The stale
  transitive edges are now pruned with `<exclusion>`s (the resolved classpath is unchanged — the pinned/newer
  versions already won nearest-wins), and `jackson-dataformat-yaml` and `jsr305` are declared directly so a
  single version of each reaches consumers. (The `mockserver-client-java` half of this was fixed in 7.1.0.)
- **Code-review hardening sweep — correctness, concurrency, resources and performance.** A repo-wide review
  surfaced and fixed a set of latent defects:
  - **Stale `hashCode` broke matching.** `KeyToMultiValue.replaceValues()`/`addNottableValues()` mutated the
    value list without refreshing the cached `hashCode` (unlike `addValue()`), so a header/parameter object
    reused on the matching hot path (e.g. via `ExpandedParameterDecoder`) could violate the `equals`/`hashCode`
    contract. The cache is now refreshed on every mutation, and the `0`-sentinel hashCode caches on
    `HttpRequest`/`HttpResponse`/`Action`/`Not` no longer defeat themselves when a hash legitimately computes to 0.
  - **`NullPointerException` serialising a chunked response with no body** — the chunked body encoder now guards a
    null body.
  - **WebSocket object-callback disconnect bug.** When a callback client disconnected mid-exchange the
    forward-object-callback handler wrote the HTTP response twice and left a `CompletableFuture` that never
    completed (pinning a scheduler thread until the future timeout); the disconnect path now writes once,
    unregisters the callback, and returns. Response/forward callback registry entries are also unregistered on
    every disconnect branch.
  - **JavaScript response templates were fully serialised** through an engine-wide lock even though each call
    already builds its own GraalVM context; the lock was removed so concurrent JS templates run in parallel.
  - **Numerous unsynchronised lazy-init / check-then-act races hardened** (template-engine and body-deserializer
    `ObjectMapper`s, the OpenAPI parse cache via `computeIfAbsent`, `JsonStringMatcher`, the Java client's Netty
    client and event bus, action-handler template engines, `LogEntry` override cache, scheduler thread numbering).
  - **Configuration round-trip gaps.** `controlPlaneScopeMapping`, the proxy-pass mappings, and
    `proxyRemoteHost`/`proxyRemotePort` now round-trip through `PUT /mockserver/config`; an unrecognised
    `logLevel` now fails fast with a clear message instead of an NPE during start-up; the conventional
    `mockserver.perExpectationMetricsEnabled` property key is accepted (the legacy key still works).
  - **Event loop no longer blocked.** Connection-delay sleeps and `awaitUninterruptibly()` calls were removed
    from the proxy/SOCKS/relay event-loop paths; the outbound HTTP client now applies a read timeout so a
    stalled upstream cannot pin a connection/future indefinitely; CONNECT-relay aggregators are bounded to the
    configured maximum body size instead of ~2 GB.
  - **Resource & memory leaks fixed.** `MemoryMonitoring` now unregisters its log/expectation listeners on stop
    (and writes its CSV via try-with-resources); the LLM completion cache and quota registry are now bounded;
    gRPC gzip frames are capped on *decompressed* size (decompression-bomb guard).
  - **Async broker mocking** publish/subscribe lifecycle is synchronised, Kafka send failures are logged, and
    subscribers expose a health flag after a broker disconnect.
  - **Clustered in-memory CAS** no longer loses a concurrent write when an entry is swapped under the same key
    (identity-conditional remove/replace).
  - **Hot-path allocations removed** (case-insensitive header/parameter lookups, matcher-listener notification,
    load-metric label arrays), and generated TLS certificates are now anchored to issuance time rather than the
    JVM start time.
  - **Control-plane endpoints can no longer be hijacked by an early (`respondBeforeBody`) expectation.** A
    catch-all `respondBeforeBody` expectation (for example one seeded from an initialization file) was matched
    before the control-plane dispatch, so it could answer the server's own management requests (e.g.
    `PUT /mockserver/reset`). Early header matching now excludes the reserved `/mockserver` control-plane path
    prefix, so management endpoints always reach the control plane.

### Security

- **`/bind` and `/stop` now honour control-plane authentication/authorization.** These mutating lifecycle
  endpoints were serviced before the auth gate; they now require the same control-plane auth as
  `/mockserver/configuration`. Default deployments with no control-plane auth configured are unaffected, and
  `/status` / `/ready` remain open for health probes. Closes the lifecycle-endpoint gap noted in 7.2.0.
- **MCP tool calls now honour control-plane authorization.** With `controlPlaneAuthorizationEnabled`, each MCP
  tool is classified read vs mutate (fail-closed) and checked against the same role model as the HTTP control
  plane, so a read-only principal can no longer invoke mutating MCP tools (create/clear/reset/…). Default
  (authorization disabled) behaviour is unchanged; enforced across HTTP and HTTP/3, single and batch. Closes
  the per-tool MCP gap noted in 7.2.0.
- **Control-plane JWT validation cross-request race fixed.** A single shared `JWTValidator` reconfigured the
  Nimbus processor (key selector + claims verifier) on every call, so concurrent control-plane requests could be
  verified against another request's policy. The processor is now configured once and `validate()` is stateless.
- **Remote JWKS / OIDC discovery fetches are now bounded.** JWKS-key-set and OIDC discovery-document fetches on
  the authentication path used the JOSE library defaults (infinite connect/read timeout, no size limit); they now
  use finite timeouts and a size cap, so a slow or hostile identity-provider endpoint can no longer hang the auth
  path or be used as an amplification vector.
- **Velocity templates can no longer fetch arbitrary URLs or read local files.** The Apache Velocity
  `ImportTool` (which exposes `$import.read(url|file)`) was registered in the template toolbox; it has been
  removed, closing an SSRF / local-file-disclosure vector in response templates.
- **mTLS control-plane authentication rejects expired client certificates.** Client-certificate authentication
  validated only that the certificate chained to the configured CA; it now also enforces the certificate
  validity window, so an expired or not-yet-valid (but correctly signed) client certificate is rejected.
- **Mock OIDC client-secret comparison is now constant-time.**

## [7.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Security

- **Control-plane role-based authorization** (off by default). With `controlPlaneAuthorizationEnabled`
  and a `controlPlaneScopeMapping` (e.g. `platform-admins=admin,qa-team=mutate,viewers=read`), an
  authenticated principal's scopes/groups are mapped to one of three hierarchical roles
  (`admin` ⊇ `mutate` ⊇ `read`): reads require `read`, every mutating operation requires `mutate`, and a
  principal lacking the role gets `403 Forbidden` (recorded in the audit log). Fail-closed — use together
  with control-plane OIDC authentication. Covers all `HttpState.handle` operations plus the Netty-serviced
  `/mockserver/configuration`, `/openapi.yaml` and `/llm/optimisationReport` reads/writes. Not yet covered:
  the lifecycle endpoints (`/bind`, `/stop`, `/status`) and per-tool MCP authorization. See
  `docs/code/tls-and-security.md`.
- **JWT control-plane validation rejects HMAC algorithms.** `JWTValidator` verifies against a public-key
  JWK set, so it now accepts only asymmetric algorithms (`RS*`/`ES*`/`PS*`/`EdDSA`) and rejects HMAC
  (`HS256/384/512`), closing an algorithm-confusion forgery vector. Switch to an asymmetric key if you
  relied on HMAC.
- **SCIM bearer-token enforcement now fails closed.** When enforcement is enabled but no expected token is
  configured, requests are rejected instead of accepting any token, and the comparison is constant-time.
- **Opt-in secret redaction in the event log and dashboard** (`redactSecretsInLog`, default off). Masks
  sensitive header values (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `x-api-key`, …) and configured JSON body fields in
  retrieved/exported logs and the dashboard event view. Matching and verification still see the original
  values, so behaviour is unchanged.
- **Dashboard `dompurify` pinned to `3.4.11`** via an npm `overrides` entry, clearing all 16 open
  Dependabot DOMPurify advisories (mXSS / DOM-clobbering / prototype-pollution).


### Added

#### AI, LLM & agent protocols (LLM / MCP / A2A)
- **LLM and MCP mock builders in every client.** Idiomatic LLM-mocking (completions, tool calls, streaming
  physics, usage, embeddings, multi-turn conversations, provider failover) and MCP-server-mocking (tools,
  resources, prompts over JSON-RPC 2.0) builders are now available in all eight clients (Java, Node, Python,
  Ruby, Go, Rust, .NET, PHP), all producing the same wire JSON.
- **LLM optimisation export.** Proxy your agent's LLM calls through MockServer, then export a one-click
  optimisation brief (Markdown) or structured JSON bundle (`LlmOptimisationReport`) from captured traffic.
  Nine deterministic signals detect repeated system prompts, low cache-hit rates, unused tool schema,
  model overspend, large resent context, deterministic tool calls, oversized tool results, output-token
  bloat and duplicate calls — each with token counts, estimated USD saving, and structured fix guidance
  (copy-paste config snippet or example expectation where applicable). An in-product **verdict** (A–F grade
  and "$X recoverable" headline computed via per-call MAX attribution so the total is always ≤ actual spend)
  and two new session KPIs (**cache-hit rate** and **one-shot rate**) appear in the dashboard and the
  Markdown brief. New **LLM Optimise** dashboard screen (with verdict banner, "Copy verdict" button, and
  updated hero cards), `GET /mockserver/llm/optimisationReport` endpoint, and `export_optimisation_report`
  MCP tool. Export-only and deterministic; secrets are redacted. The Anthropic codec now maps the top-level
  `system` field so cache and repeated-prompt signals fire on Anthropic traffic.
- **More embedding providers and rerank mocking.** `httpLlmResponse` embeddings now cover Gemini, Ollama and
  Bedrock (Titan / Cohere-on-Bedrock) in addition to OpenAI/Azure, all deterministic and L2-normalised. A new
  rerank action mocks Cohere and Voyage rerank endpoints in the provider-correct envelope.
- **MockServer's MCP control plane gains `prompts/list`, `prompts/get` and `sampling/createMessage`** over
  HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, configured via a new `McpPromptRegistry`.
- **A2A mock builder: streaming and push notifications** (opt-in). `withStreaming()` generates an SSE stream
  of task status/artifact events; `withPushNotifications(webhookUrl)` POSTs each completed task to a webhook.
- **Strict structured-output enforcement** (`enforceOutputSchema`, opt-in). A mocked completion whose body
  doesn't conform to its `outputSchema` fails loudly (`502` + diagnostic header) instead of returning the
  non-conforming body — modelling a real provider's strict `json_schema` mode. Checked before streaming begins.
- **Provider-correct LLM chaos error bodies.** Error injection emits each provider's real error shape
  (Anthropic `overloaded_error`, OpenAI `server_error`/`rate_limit_exceeded`, Gemini, Ollama) so SDK
  retry/backoff can be tested realistically. An optional `errorKind` (`OVERLOAD` / `RATE_LIMIT` /
  `SERVER_ERROR`) emits the provider's distinct body and natural HTTP status without picking the code yourself.
- **Multimodal request recognition.** Conversation decoders recognise image content parts (OpenAI `image_url`,
  Anthropic `image`, Gemini `inline_data`) and audio parts (OpenAI `input_audio`), so a request matcher can
  assert on image/audio presence; `ParsedMessage` exposes `hasImage()`/`hasAudio()` etc. A new response-side
  `toolChoice` field (`auto`/`none`/`required`/named) drives `finish_reason`. Request recognition only —
  MockServer does not store the bytes.
- **Cached / reasoning token usage fields.** `Usage` gains optional `cachedInputTokens`,
  `cacheCreationTokens` and `reasoningTokens`, decoded from each provider's usage shape and emitted on GenAI
  telemetry spans, so cost dashboards can split cached-input and reasoning spend.
- **LLM model/pricing catalog refresh** — current Claude (Opus 4.5–4.8, Sonnet 4.5/4.6, Haiku 4.5, Fable 5),
  OpenAI (gpt-4.1, o3/o4) and Gemini 2.5 families, with most-specific-prefix matching. `gpt-5*` entries are
  flagged placeholders — confirm against the provider price list.
- **Approximate token-count utility and opt-in usage inference** (`llmInferUsageEnabled`, default off). A
  mocked completion that omits `usage` can be auto-populated with estimated token counts (documented as an
  estimate, not a real BPE tokenizer); existing responses are unchanged.
- **AMQP 0.9.1 (RabbitMQ) broker mocking** in the AsyncAPI module, alongside the existing Kafka and MQTT
  support (configure via `asyncAmqpUri`).
- **Agent framework recipes** (docs): a new `ai_agent_frameworks.html` page with recipes for pointing
  LlamaIndex and the OpenAI Agents SDK at MockServer to mock LLM provider calls.

#### Identity provider mocking (OIDC / OAuth2 / SAML / SCIM)
- **One-call mock OIDC / OAuth2 provider.** `PUT /mockserver/oidc` (or `mockOpenIdProvider()`) stands up a
  complete IdP — discovery, JWKS, token, authorize, userinfo, introspection, revocation, logout — with the
  full OAuth2 authorization-code flow (PKCE S256/plain), client-credentials, refresh-token, and the device
  authorization grant (RFC 8628). Tokens are minted at request time (correct `nonce`/`at_hash`, `id_token`
  split from `access_token`); signing is configurable (RS/ES 256/384/512). Optional token-endpoint client
  authentication (`enforceClientAuthentication`) and opaque access tokens with working `/introspect`.
- **Verified OIDC bearer authentication for the control plane** (`controlPlaneOidcAuthenticationRequired`,
  off by default). Verifies the `Authorization: Bearer` token against an external IdP's JWK set (direct or
  discovered), asserting issuer, audience, `exp`/`nbf` and required scopes, and records the verified `sub`
  as the audit principal. Combinable with mTLS and JWT control-plane auth.
- **One-call mock SAML 2.0 IdP.** `PUT /mockserver/saml` stands up a mock IdP (metadata + SP-initiated POST
  SSO) returning an XML-DSig-signed assertion with configurable subject/attributes. Configurable signing
  algorithm (RS/ES 256/384/512), Single Logout, and negative-test flags (`expiredAssertion`, `wrongAudience`,
  `tamperedSignature`) to exercise an SP's rejection paths. Typed `mockSamlProvider(...)` Java API; inbound
  parsing is XXE-hardened.
- **One-call mock SCIM 2.0 provider.** `PUT /mockserver/scim` (or `mockScimProvider(...)`) generates an
  in-memory SCIM provider: CRUD over `Users`/`Groups`, discovery documents, `application/scim+json` shapes,
  single-attribute filtering (`eq`/`co`/`sw`/`pr`), `PatchOp`, pagination, an optional bearer-token gate and
  configurable base path/seed data.

#### Load injection, chaos & SRE
- **API-driven load generation via Load Scenarios** (`loadGenerationEnabled`, off by default). A named,
  registry-based control plane (`PUT/GET/DELETE /mockserver/loadScenario`, `/start`, `/stop`) drives outbound
  traffic at a target: load a scenario by name, then trigger one or many to run **concurrently**, each with
  its own `startDelayMillis`. A scenario is a list of request steps (template-rendered per iteration with an
  `iteration` context) with per-step think-time and a `profile` of ordered **stages** — closed-model VU
  stages, open-model arrival-rate (iterations/sec) stages with `LINEAR`/`EXPONENTIAL`/`QUADRATIC` ramp curves,
  and pauses — composing step/spike/soak/stress shapes. Scenarios can be preloaded at startup
  (`loadScenarioInitializationJsonPath`). Bounded by hard caps on VUs, rate, stages and concurrent scenarios.
  Full registry API and runnable examples in all eight clients.
- **First-class load-injection metrics** (Prometheus + OTEL). A load run exposes a dedicated
  `mock_server_load_*` family — request duration histogram (with `trace_id` exemplars), iterations, bytes,
  throttles, errors-by-kind, and live `active_vus`/`inflight` gauges — labelled by
  `scenario, run_id, step, route, method, status_class` (with auto-templatized low-cardinality routes and
  opt-in custom labels). Zero-cost when metrics are off; `mock_server_forward_*` is unchanged.
- **SLO resilience verdicts** (`sloTrackingEnabled`, off by default). A windowed sample store records latency
  and error per forwarded round-trip; `PUT /mockserver/verifySLO` evaluates latency-percentile and error-rate
  objectives and returns a structured verdict (`200` PASS / `406` FAIL / `400` malformed). Pairs with chaos:
  drive faults, then assert the system stayed within objectives.
- **Connection-lifecycle fault injection and preemption simulation.** The per-host TCP chaos profile gains
  mid-response RST, jittered slow-close and HTTP/2 GOAWAY faults. A new `PUT/GET/DELETE /mockserver/preemption`
  simulates a Kubernetes rolling-update / spot-reclaim drain — cordoning new exchanges, reporting in-flight
  count, and auto-uncordoning after a TTL — without stopping the JVM.
- **Saved chaos profile library.** Save/apply/list/delete chaos experiments by name
  (`/mockserver/chaosExperiment/profiles/{name}`, `/apply/{name}`). Profiles persist in the `StateBackend`,
  so they survive a reset and replicate across a cluster. The dashboard Chaos panel gains a Saved Profiles list.
- **Scheduled chaos experiment start.** A chaos experiment can carry `startDelayMillis` (fixed delay) and/or
  `cronSchedule` (5-field cron, JVM time zone, minute granularity); it sits in a `scheduled` status until the
  scheduled time. No scheduling fields = immediate start (unchanged).
- **General-purpose rate limiting** (`rateLimit` expectation clause, off by default). A protocol-agnostic
  clause returns a deterministic `429` with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers once a matched
  expectation exceeds its rate, via `fixed_window` or `token_bucket` algorithms, with an optional named shared
  counter — so a test can exercise client backoff without a chaos profile.
- **Retry/backoff recovery primitive** (`recoverAfter` on `httpResponse`, opt-in). Returns a failure response
  (default `503`) for the first `failTimes` matches and then the success response, so a test can deterministically
  exercise client retry/backoff. An optional `idempotencyHeader` scopes the counter per request-header value.
- **Stream-level error injection** (HTTP/2 / HTTP/3). `httpError().withStreamError(...)` resets a matched
  request stream with a given error code (HTTP/2 `RST_STREAM`, HTTP/3 `RESET_STREAM`) without affecting other
  multiplexed streams; HTTP/1.1 falls back to dropping the connection. Also on the Node, Python and Ruby clients.
- **Conditional breakpoints.** Breakpoint matchers accept `skipCount` (pause only after N matching hits) and,
  on the RESPONSE phase, `responseStatusCodeMin`/`Max` and `responseBodyContains` so a breakpoint can pause
  only on, e.g., `5xx` responses or a body containing a particular message.

#### Request matching & response generation
- **Per-expectation hit-count response branching** (`SWITCH` response mode + optional `switchAfter`). With an
  index-aligned `httpResponses` list, an expectation serves the first response for its first `N` matches then
  advances — ideal for "succeed, then start failing" on a single endpoint without a full scenario.
- **Weighted/probabilistic response selection** (`WEIGHTED` response mode + `responseWeights`, e.g. `[90, 10]`).
- **Generate a schema-valid response body from an inline JSON Schema** (`generateFromSchema`). Synthesises a
  schema-valid body at response time, reusing the OpenAPI example engine; fires only when the response has no
  explicit body.
- **Regex path capture groups exposed to templates** via `request.pathGroups` (numbered) and
  `request.namedPathGroups`, usable from Mustache, Velocity and JavaScript.
- **Request-driven (template) response delay** — a `delay` may carry a `template`+`templateType` rendered
  against the request, so e.g. larger payloads respond slower.
- **Conditional (if-then-else) request matcher** (`conditionalRequestDefinition` with `if`/`then`/`else`).
- **Accept-header content-negotiation matching** — an opt-in `accept:<media-type>` header-matcher directive
  matches per RFC 7231 (q-weights, wildcards, specificity).
- **Conditional and chainable response modifiers** — a forward/override modifier may carry a `condition`
  (status code / range / header presence) and/or an ordered `modifiers` chain where each sees the previous output.
- **Deterministic fuzzy body matcher** (`FuzzyBody`) — matches when the request body is similar enough to an
  expected string by Jaro-Winkler ratio at or above a configurable threshold (a non-LLM similarity match).
- **Case-sensitive matching opt-in** (`matchExactCase`, default off). When enabled, method, path and regex
  string-body matching become case-sensitive; header/cookie/query matching always stays case-insensitive.
- **Default response headers** (`defaultResponseHeaders`) — stamp organisation-wide headers (`Server`,
  trace id, …) onto every response (mock, forwarded, proxied), applied add-if-absent.
- **Match and verify by negotiated protocol** (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). `withProtocol(...)` on an
  expectation or `verify(...)` matches/asserts on the protocol a request arrived over; the new `HTTP_3` value
  (experimental) is server-trusted via the `h3` ALPN identifier, and protocol now round-trips through
  recorded requests.
- **HTTP response trailers** — `httpResponse().withTrailers(...)` emits protocol-appropriate trailing headers
  (chunked + `Trailer` on HTTP/1.1, a trailing HEADERS frame on HTTP/2/3). gRPC responses are unaffected.
- **Expectation namespacing / multi-tenancy** — an optional `namespace` field plus a configurable match header
  (`matchNamespaceHeader`, default `X-MockServer-Namespace`) lets teams share one instance without colliding;
  scoped `clear`/`retrieve` and Java `clearByNamespace`/`retrieveActiveExpectations(...)`.
- **`multipart/form-data` request-body matching** (`MultipartBody`) — match individual parts by field
  name/value, filename and content-type; OpenAPI multipart bodies build field matchers from the schema.
- **Numeric comparison operators** (`> 60`, `>= 60`, `< 100`, `<= 30`, `== 5`, `!== 5`) for header, cookie and
  query-string values.
- **Declarative `capture` rules and scenario-state templates.** A `capture` rule extracts a value from the
  matched request (jsonPath/xpath/header/query/cookie/pathParameter) into scenario state; templates can read
  and write scenario state via a `scenario` helper — enabling auth→resource→confirm journeys.
- **New response-template helpers** — `crypto` (md5/sha1/sha256/sha512/hmacSha256), `regex`
  (matches/replaceAll/group), `html`, `csv`, `xpath` (XXE-hardened) and `yaml`, plus `jsonPath`/`xPath`
  request-body extraction now in the Velocity and JavaScript engines (previously Mustache only).

#### Proxying, forwarding & recording
- **Upstream forward retry policy and per-upstream circuit breaker** (opt-in, off by default). Retry
  re-issues idempotent (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/PUT/DELETE/TRACE) calls on a connection error or 502/503/504 with
  linear back-off; the circuit breaker trips open (fail-fast `503`) after N consecutive failures to a
  `host:port`, then half-opens. Open upstreams export `mock_server_upstream_circuit_open` when metrics are on.
- **Upstream connection pooling** (`forwardConnectionPoolEnabled`, default `true`). Idle HTTP/1.1 keep-alive
  upstream connections are pooled and reused, eliminating per-request TCP/TLS handshakes and the ephemeral-port
  exhaustion that caused request errors under sustained forward load (a k6 baseline of 21%/68% errors at
  750/1500 rps dropped to ~0%). Safe by default: the forward client runs on its own event-loop group (no
  self-deadlock in synchronous local callbacks) and a channel is only pooled when its codec is genuinely
  quiescent. Only plain HTTP/1.1 keep-alive is pooled — HTTP/2, HTTP/3, binary, streaming, tunnelled and
  `Connection: close` connections always use a fresh connection. Set to `false` to restore the old behaviour.
- **One-command record round-trip.** `GET/PUT /mockserver/retrieve?type=RECORDED_EXPECTATIONS&format=...` now
  accepts `forwardUnmatchedTo=<upstream>`, arming record-and-forward of unmatched requests and returning the
  recorded expectations (in any supported language/JSON) in one call — removing the multi-step proxy setup.
  The upstream is SSRF-validated before any state is mutated.
- **JSON Patch / JSON Merge Patch on forwarded responses.** A response modifier may carry an inline `jsonPatch`
  (RFC 6902) and/or `jsonMergePatch` (RFC 7386) applied to a forwarded/proxied JSON response body, so one field
  of a real upstream response can be changed without replacing the whole body. `jsonPatch` runs first; a
  non-JSON body or failed patch leaves the body unchanged.
- **Redact secrets in recorded traffic.** `redactSecretsInRecordedExpectations` (off by default) masks
  sensitive request headers when recorded expectations are retrieved, generated as code, or persisted; HAR and
  Postman imports redact sensitive headers and common secret body fields by default. Redaction preserves
  `times`/`timeToLive`/`priority`/`id` so recordings still replay.
- **Smart deduplication and templatization of recorded traffic.** Collapse many recorded requests that differ
  only by an id segment (`/users/123`, `/users/456`) into one `/users/{id}` expectation and drop exact
  duplicates. With `templatizeRecordedValues` (opt-in), volatile query/header/JSON-body values (UUIDs, ids,
  dates, JWTs, opaque tokens) are also generalized into matchers, while stable values are kept verbatim.
- **Baseline traffic drift comparison.** `PUT /mockserver/baseline/compare` diffs current recorded
  interactions against a saved baseline and returns a structured added/removed/changed report (value-insensitive
  JSON-shape comparison), usable from CI.

#### Verification
- **Timeout-aware verification** (Java client). `verify(..., Duration timeout)` polls until the verification
  passes or times out (for async / fire-and-forget code), and `verifyNever(..., Duration window)` asserts a
  condition stays unmet for the whole window. Implemented client-side; existing snapshot `verify(...)` is unchanged.
- **Soft/collecting verification and verify-by-disposition.** `verifyAll(...)` runs every supplied
  verification and throws one error listing all mismatches instead of failing on the first.
  `Verification.withDisposition(FORWARDED | MOCKED)` narrows a count to requests that were forwarded vs matched
  a mock.
- **Response verification: status-code range / operator matching** — a response template may match by class
  range (`statusCodeRange: "2XX"`) or operator (`">= 400"`); verification-only, never written to the wire.
- **Field-level closest-match diff for failures.** When `detailedVerificationFailures` is enabled (default),
  a failed sequence verification — and response verification — now appends a per-step "closest match diff"
  naming the fields that differ. Response reason-phrase matching honours `matchExactCase`, and response cookies
  use the same sub-set/notted semantics as the request side. Diagnostic only; pass/fail is unchanged.

#### OpenAPI & contract testing
- **Opt-in OpenAPI request validation during mock matching** (`validateRequestsAgainstOpenApiSpec`, off by
  default). A request matched by a spec-backed expectation is validated against that spec before the action is
  dispatched; a violation is rejected with `400` and an `OPENAPI_REQUEST_VALIDATION_FAILED` event. Previously
  validation only ran on the proxy/forward path.
- **OpenAPI contract testing endpoint** (`PUT /mockserver/contractTest`). Runs a spec as contract tests against
  a live service: builds a representative request per operation, sends it (with the same SSRF protection as
  forwarding), validates the response, and returns a pass/fail-per-operation report. Optional `operationId`
  restricts the run.
- **Enforce OpenAPI response validation for mocks** (`enforceResponseValidationForMocks`, off by default). When
  enabled alongside response validation, a mock response that fails validation is replaced with a `502`,
  matching the proxy-path enforcement; default stays advisory-only.
- **Pact provider-state preconditions and v3 import.** Pact `providerState(s)` round-trip on import/verify/export
  and map onto a MockServer scenario, so an imported interaction only matches once its state is active.
  `PUT /mockserver/import?format=pact` (or `/pact/import`) imports Pact v3 consumer contracts as expectations.
- **Deterministic OpenAPI example generation** — an optional reproducibility seed and per-field value overrides
  via a reserved `__generationOptions__` entry in the operations map.
- **Auth in generated Postman & Bruno collections** — the collection generator now emits collection-level auth
  (bearer / API key / basic from `securitySchemes`, else a placeholder JWT bearer) with blank placeholder
  credentials, so the collections still work against an unauthenticated MockServer.

#### gRPC & GraphQL
- **GraphQL and AsyncAPI spec import.** `PUT /mockserver/graphql` imports SDL / introspection and generates
  schema-valid expectations per root operation; `PUT /mockserver/asyncapi/http` turns AsyncAPI channels into
  GET expectations serving schema-aware payloads.
- **GraphQL schema-driven response synthesis.** A GraphQL body may carry a `schema` (SDL or introspection JSON);
  MockServer then synthesises a schema-valid `{"data": {...}}` for a matched query with no hand-authored
  response — honouring types, nullability, lists, enums, aliases, `__typename`, and fragments. Backed by
  `graphql-java` (22.x, Java-17-compatible).
- **gRPC example synthesis from descriptors.** A matched gRPC expectation with a successful (`grpc-status: 0`)
  response and no hand-authored body returns a schema-valid example synthesised from the proto descriptor's
  response type (scalars, enums, nested/repeated/map fields, `oneof`, well-known types) instead of an empty
  frame. Explicit bodies are never overwritten.
- **gRPC bidi-stream response templating** — a `grpcBidiResponse` may set `templateType` (`VELOCITY`/`MUSTACHE`)
  so its `json` renders against the matched inbound message.
- **gRPC Connect protocol** (buf.build) unary mocking via `ConnectResponse.success(json)` /
  `ConnectResponse.error(code, message)`; real `application/grpc` traffic is unaffected.
- **gRPC descriptor management in all clients** — upload a compiled descriptor set, list services, and clear,
  bringing every client to parity with Java.

#### Dashboard UI
- **Performance panel for load scenarios.** Author, run, monitor, stop and edit load scenarios from the UI.
  A shared named-scenario registry (lifecycle-state badges, multi-select start, per-row edit/start/stop/delete)
  sits above two sub-tabs: **Run & Monitor** (live "Running now" cards, status, the multi-scenario chart and
  post-run summary) and **Create / Edit** (the stage-builder form with generated register-and-start client
  code rendered inline below it). The code uses each client's idiomatic load-scenario builders
  (`loadScenario(...).withProfile(LoadProfile.of(LoadStage.constantVus(...)))`, etc.) rather than raw JSON —
  matching the Mock and Verification code generators — across Java, Node, Python, Go, C#, Ruby and Rust (plus
  raw JSON and curl), and regenerates live as you fill in the form. The view follows the task — editing a
  scenario switches to Create / Edit, starting a run switches to Run & Monitor. The chart plots every
  concurrently-running scenario at once — a
  line per scenario plus an aggregate "all scenarios" total — with independent toggles for which metrics to
  show (RPS, VUs, in-flight, p50/p95/p99, error rate) and which scenarios to include (all enabled by default).
  Each run shows a determinate progress bar (elapsed / total profile duration), green while driving load and
  amber while paused.
- **Contract and Cluster panels.** **Contract** runs an OpenAPI spec against a live service and renders a
  pass/fail-per-operation table; **Cluster** shows state-backend cluster status (node id, coordinator,
  members), auto-refreshing.
- **Monaco code editor for body matchers** with syntax highlighting, per-type language modes (JSON, XML,
  GraphQL, plaintext) and live JSON / JSON-Schema validation (inline red squiggles before submit). Monaco and
  its workers are bundled and served locally (no runtime CDN).
- **Before→after preview diff** when creating or editing a mock — the "Capture as Mock" dialog and the
  Composer's Review step show a side-by-side JSON diff of what will be created/changed, via a bundled Monaco
  `JsonDiffViewer`.
- **gRPC services view** listing loaded services and methods with per-service health, auto-refreshing.
- **Scenario state-machine diagram** — the selected scenario's states and transitions render as a live Mermaid
  `stateDiagram-v2` with the current state highlighted, built from what the panel observes.
- **Named-example picker for OpenAPI imports** — when a pasted inline spec declares multiple named response
  examples, a per-operation dropdown chooses which the generated mock returns (sent as `operationsAndResponses`).
- **Set breakpoint from a log row** — a log entry's pause action pre-fills a breakpoint matcher from that
  request's method and path and jumps to the Breakpoints form.
- **Duplicate an expectation, plus a priority column** — per-row Duplicate opens the Composer with an id-stripped
  copy; a `P<n>` chip and a sortable Priority header show match order.
- **Usability, responsiveness and new surfaces** (an adversarial-review pass): per-row delete/edit of a single
  mock; auto-refreshing live panels (Drift, Breakpoints, AsyncAPI, MCP); a Quick/Advanced Composer toggle with
  plain-language tooltips; SAML provider mocking; a responsive layout that works on tablet/mobile (collapsing
  grid, adaptive "More" navigation, full-screen dialogs); resizable panels; a keyboard-shortcuts help dialog;
  baseline-compare; real Mermaid agent-run graphs; and inspect/edit-restart of a running chaos experiment.
- **Request-log enhancements** — timestamps on each entry, regex filtering on method/path with saved named
  filter presets, a side-by-side visual diff in "Why didn't this match?", a matcher test playground, and
  authoring of `capture` rules in the Composer.

#### IDE extensions (VS Code & JetBrains)
- **Expectation-file schema support.** `*.mockserver.json(c)` files get inline schema validation, autocompletion
  and hover docs, driven by the same schema MockServer validates against (generated from `mockserver-core`).
- **In-IDE breakpoint debugger** over the callback WebSocket — register a matcher, receive paused exchanges, and
  Continue / Modify / Abort on requests and responses, including per-frame stream editing. Breakpoints fire only
  on traffic through MockServer.
- **Author, verify and record against a running server** — load expectations, save recorded expectations (as
  JSON or DSL — record-to-code), generate expectations from an OpenAPI spec, run scratch-request match analysis,
  send ad-hoc test requests, view the request log, and reset.
- **Mock-drift surfacing** — a drift report, inline drift diagnostics on the expectation file (VS Code), and a
  "update stub to match upstream" quick-fix.
- **Distributed-trace tooling** — Find Requests by Trace (trace id → received requests) and View Trace in Backend
  (trace id → open the correlated trace in Jaeger/Tempo/Grafana via a configurable URL template).
- **LLM authoring and agent-run call graph**, an OpenAPI contract-test runner, and WASM module upload/list — in
  both extensions.
- **In-IDE dashboard** embedded via JCEF / a webview, with graceful fallback to an external browser.
- The Docker image, container name and port are configurable, and the image tag now defaults to the extension's
  own version so it can't drift behind the release.

#### Client libraries
- **Callbacks across the clients.** Class callbacks (`httpResponseClassCallback` / `httpForwardClassCallback`)
  are now available in Go, .NET, Rust, PHP, Node, Ruby and Python; object/closure callbacks
  (`mockWithCallback(...)`, response written in your own language over the callback WebSocket) are in Go, .NET,
  Rust, Node and Python. PHP supports class callbacks only (REST-only).
- **Control-plane auth and TLS/mTLS across the clients.** Go, .NET, Rust, PHP, Node and Python clients can now
  connect to a secured MockServer — a static or per-request bearer token, a CA certificate to trust the
  server's TLS, and a client certificate + key for mutual TLS. Default behaviour is unchanged.
- **Advanced response builders across the clients.** SSE, WebSocket, DNS, binary and gRPC-stream response
  builders, OpenAPI import, and verify-zero-interactions are now in the Go, Rust, .NET, PHP and Node clients,
  moving them toward parity with Java/Python.
- **Retrieve expectations as generated client code in every language.** `retrieve?format=<language>` now
  produces copy-paste-ready upsert code (and verification code for recorded requests) in Java, JavaScript,
  Python, Go, C#, Ruby, Rust and PHP, with correct per-language string escaping; the non-Java clients expose
  `retrieveExpectationsAsCode(format)` / `retrieveRecordedExpectationsAsCode(format)`. The dashboard
  Library → Export tab offers all eight languages plus a verification-code option.
- **Client test-framework fixtures and idiomatic auto-cleanup** that reset the server between tests — Go
  (`MockServerT` / `t.Cleanup`), Node (`await using` via `Symbol.asyncDispose`), Ruby (RSpec shared context),
  .NET (`MockServerFixture` / `IAsyncLifetime`), PHP (`MockServerTestTrait`). A new `client_compatibility.html`
  page documents an 8×8 feature matrix and per-language test-fixture snippets.
- **Clearer launcher errors** — the Go/Node/Python/Ruby/Rust/PHP auto-download launchers detect a 404 on the
  release bundle and fail with an actionable message (naming a version that ships bundles, the Docker image, or
  the Maven Central jar) instead of a raw 404.

#### CLI & configuration
- **`--watch` live-reload and a `mockserver demo` subcommand.** `run --watch` live-reloads expectations when
  the `--init`/`--openapi` file changes (a CLI surface over `watchInitializationJson`); `mockserver demo`
  starts a server pre-loaded with example expectations and prints getting-started/dashboard URLs and a sample
  `curl`.
- **`mockserver import <file>` subcommand and client `importExpectations(...)`** — load a JSON expectations file
  into an already-running server without restarting it.
- **Effective-configuration diagnostic** — `--print-config` prints every known property as `name = value [source]`
  (with sensitive values redacted) and exits; the same report is available at runtime from the authenticated
  `GET /mockserver/config`.
- **Readiness endpoint** (`GET /mockserver/ready`) — returns `503` until initializers and OpenAPI seeding
  complete, then `200`, distinct from the always-`200` liveness/status endpoints; the Helm chart now uses it
  for the readiness probe.
- **Fail-fast and typo detection** — `failOnInitializationError` fails startup on a malformed init file instead
  of silently continuing with zero expectations, and MockServer now logs a `WARN` for unrecognised
  `mockserver.*` / `MOCKSERVER_*` keys (e.g. a typo) instead of silently ignoring them.
- **Graceful shutdown drains in-flight requests** — on stop, MockServer waits up to `stopDrainMillis`
  (default 15000) for active requests to complete, avoiding cut connections during rolling restarts.
- More configuration properties (matching/proxying, logging, CORS) are editable at runtime from the dashboard
  configuration dialog.

#### WASM custom rules
- **Richer WASM matcher ABI, authoring SDK, and a test endpoint.** A module exporting `match_request(ptr, len)`
  now receives the request method, path and headers (as a JSON envelope) in addition to the body, with
  fallback to the legacy body-only `match(...)`. A new dependency-free Rust authoring crate
  (`mockserver-wasm-sdk`) gives typed accessors, and `POST /mockserver/wasm/test` runs a module against a
  sample request and returns `{ "matched": … }` so a module can be validated without creating a live expectation.

#### Clustering & observability
- **Cluster status endpoint and metric.** `GET /mockserver/cluster` reports cluster membership/health
  (`clustered`, `nodeId`, `coordinator`, `clusterName`, members), degenerate-but-valid on a single node and
  real JGroups membership with the Infinispan backend; a `mock_server_cluster_members` gauge exports the count.
- **Drift alerting webhook** (`driftAlertWebhookEnabled`, off by default). Fires a fire-and-forget `POST`
  carrying the drift record whenever a stored drift meets the configured severity threshold, with a
  per-signature cooldown. Fully fail-soft — a bad endpoint can never affect drift analysis or the served response.
- **Control-plane audit logging** (`controlPlaneAuditEnabled`, off by default). An append-only, bounded,
  in-memory log of control-plane mutations (who/what/when/where/outcome) recording redacted structural metadata
  only — never headers or bodies. Retrieve via `GET /mockserver/audit`; cleared on reset.
- **Per-upstream forward/proxy observability** — `mock_server_forward_request_duration_seconds` and
  `mock_server_forward_requests` labelled by `upstream_host` (and `status_class`), plus `server.address`/
  `server.port` attributes on the forward span. Host-only labels keep cardinality bounded.
- **Dropped-log-event visibility** — when the event-log ring buffer is full, dropped events are counted and
  exported as `mock_server_dropped_log_events` (previously INFO/DEBUG drops vanished silently), with a single
  WARN on the first drop.
- **Optional per-expectation metrics** (`perExpectationMetricsEnabled`, off by default) — a
  `mock_server_expectation_matched` counter labelled by stable expectation id.


### Changed

- **Demo now showcases LLM cost optimisation.** `npm run demo` seeds a crafted seven-call support-agent run
  designed to fire all six optimisation signals, so the **LLM Optimise** tab is populated out of the box. An
  optional documented recipe shows how to capture real agent traffic by proxying a headless OpenCode run.
- **Dashboard navigation.** The **Optimise** tab is renamed **LLM Optimise** and sits after **Chaos**; the
  **Sessions** tab is renamed **Trace** and sits after **Traffic**; the **Scenarios** state-machine panel moved
  from Trace to a tab on the **Mocks** page. Each tab now shows a one-line description bar, and the Get Started
  page leads with the same six features (including LLM Optimise and Performance Testing tiles).
- **Dashboard visual refresh and scale.** A real design system (consistent spacing/shadows/typography,
  dark-mode-aware log colours), KPI hero cards and a real time axis on Metrics, skeleton loaders, and humanised
  server-error messages. Long lists (Log Messages, Active Expectations, Requests) are now viewport-virtualized
  so panels with tens of thousands of entries scroll smoothly, and the dashboard is usable on small screens and
  the IDE-embedded view (driven by CSS container queries).
- **Performance.** WASM modules, Mustache templates and OpenAPI schema validators are now parsed/compiled once
  and cached (measured ~50–66% less time and allocation on the OpenAPI validation path), and per-request object
  churn in the OIDC, SAML and LLM endpoints is reduced. Behaviour and security settings are unchanged.
- **Faster request matching with many expectations** — the incoming request's headers, cookies and query/path
  parameters are converted to matcher form once per request and reused across every candidate expectation,
  cutting per-request allocations and CPU. Matching behaviour is unchanged.
- **`HttpRequest.withBody((String) null)` now leaves the body unset** (matching `HttpResponse`), so
  `getBodyAsString()` returns `null` and the request serializes with no `body` field. Body matching is
  unchanged — a null string body still matches any body. `withBody("")` is unaffected.
- **JSON Schema body matching no longer resolves remote `$ref`s** (http/https/file/jar/ftp) by default — an
  SSRF hardening. Internal/inline refs are unaffected; set `jsonSchemaAllowRemoteRefs=true` to restore.
- **Client default MockServer version aligned to the released version** across the Node, Rust, Python and PHP
  clients, so none defaults to downloading a stale server binary. Several client connection/error-handling
  leaks were also fixed (Python/Ruby now always close the HTTP response; the Node client rejects with the real
  error message instead of an empty `{}`).
- IDE extension polish — Marketplace-ready icons and landing pages, grouped/iconified actions, a VS Code
  Activity Bar side panel and status-bar item, configurable port, and clearer validation warnings before
  submitting a file.


### Fixed

#### Correctness & reliability
- **`crossProtocolScenarios` was rejected by the expectation schema** — present in the model and honoured at
  runtime but missing from the validation schema, so any expectation using it was rejected with `400`. Added to
  the expectation and embedded-OpenAPI schemas.
- **`not(...)` expectations now match correctly with fail-fast matching enabled (the default).** A negated
  matcher could wrongly report a non-match when a non-method field matched before the first mismatching field
  (any expectation with an odd number of NOT flags). The fix only short-circuits when no NOT operator is in play
  and evaluates all fields otherwise, so the verdict always equals a full evaluation. Affected path, header and body.
- **Response body matching now has full parity with request body matching.** Matching a proxied/forwarded
  response body used a stripped-down dispatch missing several behaviours (XML/form→JSON conversion, template
  bodies, multipart routing, compressed-byte binary matching) and could swallow an internal NullPointer on a
  bodyless response into a silent non-match. Request and response body matching now share a single dispatch;
  request matching is unchanged.
- **Scenario state no longer advances when a matching expectation is skipped** by a `withPercentage` gate
  (a consume-then-skip bug); the transition now applies only when the response is actually served, atomically
  (compare-and-set) so a clustered backend preserves the "exactly one winner" guarantee.
- **Configuration round-trip no longer drops properties.** `ConfigurationDTO` mirrored only about half of the
  configuration, so many settings (SLO tracking, load generation, drift alerting, HTTP/3, gRPC, DNS, WASM,
  clustering, OpenTelemetry, audit, forward pool/retry/circuit-breaker, redaction, and more) were silently lost
  when configuration was serialized and reloaded; all are now mirrored, guarded by a reflection-driven test.
- **Load-injection traffic no longer floods the request log.** A running load run filled the bounded event log
  and evicted real/LLM traffic (emptying the Traffic/Trace/LLM views); load requests are now kept out of the
  driver's event log via an in-process-only flag (gated by `loadGenerationSuppressEventLog`, default `true`).
  Metrics and SLO samples are unaffected.
- **Concurrency hardening** (code-quality review): thread-safe log timestamps (immutable `DateTimeFormatter`),
  safely-published compiled regexes and lazily-built LLM conversation matchers (`volatile`), a thread-safe
  callback WebSocket registry, exact load-scenario VU accounting, a race-free OIDC device-code poll counter,
  atomic SCIM resource updates, gRPC chaos honouring its configured probability, and recycled log entries fully
  reset on reuse.
- **Other correctness fixes** — generated curl/Java/HAR output is now correctly escaped; expectation
  persistence writes atomically (temp-file + rename); path/matrix parameter names with regex metacharacters
  match literally; matchers prefixed with only `?`/`!` no longer throw; `VerificationTimes` rejects negative
  counts; a CONNECT/SOCKS tunnel buffer leak is fixed; one client's `reset()`/`stop()` no longer tears down
  other clients on the same port; a control-plane body filter no longer matches a request with no body via a
  literal `"null"` (stringification removed); and S3 persistence no longer throws on an empty/missing prefix
  listing.
- **GraalVM Engine leak in the JavaScript template engine** — a per-instance native `Engine` was never closed
  and accumulated under per-call construction, exhausting CI forks; it is now a single process-wide shared
  engine with a disposing `close()` on the thread-local context. Output and the `Java.type(...)` security
  boundary are unchanged.
- **Dashboard `favicon.svg` (and any SVG) now serves a valid `Content-Type: image/svg+xml`** — the missing
  `svg` MIME mapping produced a `null` header value that crashed Netty's encoder; the mapper now skips
  null-valued headers and falls back to `application/octet-stream` (issue #2358).
- **mTLS startup with a supplied full-chain certificate on Java 17** — a leaf+CA PEM was appending the CA twice
  (`[leaf, CA, CA]`), which Java 17's PKCS12 keystore rejects; the chain is now de-duplicated to `[leaf, CA]`.
- **Rust client** — expectations with a finite `times`/`timeToLive` no longer fail with `missing field
  'unlimited'`, and `VerificationTimes::at_least(n)` now serializes the unbounded `atMost: -1` sentinel instead
  of an impossible `between(n, 0)`.

#### Dashboard UI
- An error boundary keeps the dashboard from crashing to a blank screen when a view fails to load; the Drift
  panel surfaces failures instead of reporting false success; the import dialog no longer reports a misleading
  "Imported 0 expectations"; the traffic comparison counter/button no longer disagree; non-HTTP expectations no
  longer render their id twice; and a "Capture as mock" body matcher can be added when the captured request had
  no body. Plus efficiency fixes (single serialization per row on each WebSocket push, memoized traffic rows,
  TTL-only countdown timer) and consistent error humanisation.

#### IDE extensions (VS Code & JetBrains)
- The JetBrains plugin is no longer capped to IDE build 253 (`untilBuild` removed, so it stays available in
  current and future IDEs) and no longer risks an `AlreadyDisposedException` when a project is closed while an
  HTTP request is in flight; JetBrains JSON-schema completion/validation for `*.mockserver.json(c)` now works
  in IntelliJ (registered under the correct extension point, with a navigable root and no network schema
  fetch). The VS Code extension now activates on `onStartupFinished`, so the status-bar item and CodeLens
  appear immediately on a fresh window.

#### Request matching & verification
- **Notted key in `MATCHING_KEY` mode now asserts key-absence** (`!X` means "no key `X` present") instead of
  aggregating values from every other key.
- **Closest-expectation diagnostics** no longer count non-HTTP fields in the denominator for an HTTP request or
  collapse the matched-field count under fail-fast (diagnostic-only).
- **Faster expectation registration** — registering large numbers of expectations on the in-memory backend was
  O(n²) (two full reconciliation passes per add); the non-clustered path now does an eviction-only trim,
  restoring linear time.
- **Response-modifier fidelity in codegen** — `retrieve?format=JAVA` now emits a modifier's `condition`,
  `modifiers`, `jsonPatch` and `jsonMergePatch`, and the Node `responseModifier` typedef declares them.
- **Verification fixes** — response verification no longer counts MockServer's own auto-generated no-match
  `404`s; response-aware sequences with mismatched request/response list lengths are rejected instead of padding
  with always-matching nulls; an entirely-empty sequence is rejected; a recorded pair with a null request is a
  non-match instead of an NPE; failing response-sequence messages now show the responses; and a verification
  whose request filter fails to build now completes instead of hanging.

#### OpenAPI & contract testing
- **`allOf: [ $ref to a scalar ]` example generation** no longer wraps the scalar in a single-element array
  (`{"baz": ["hello"]}` → `{"baz": "hello"}`), which broke clients typed against the spec (#2357).
- **OpenAPI handling hardened across both directions** (audit follow-up to #2357): range status-code keys
  (`2XX`) no longer crash import and validate correctly; distinct specs sharing an `info.title` no longer delete
  each other's expectations (namespace now keyed by a SHA-256 of the source); expectations→OpenAPI export is
  now schema-valid and faithful (path parameters templated, negated/schema matchers preserved, same path+method
  responses merged, correct media types); `contextPathPrefix` is accepted by its schema; pinning an undefined
  `statusCode`/`exampleName` warns and falls back instead of silently returning an empty `200`; a webhooks-only
  3.1 spec no longer NPEs; and a re-imported URL/file spec now evicts the cache so it picks up current content.
- **XML response bodies are now real, spec-correct XML** for `application/xml`/`text/xml`/`+xml` responses,
  serialised using the schema's `xml` metadata (name/namespace/prefix/attribute/wrapped) per the OpenAPI XML
  Object rules, fixing earlier malformed pluralised/recursive output. OAS 3.1 multi-type `type` arrays are
  preserved (`["string","null"]` → `string` + `nullable`). (Behaviour change for XML responses; JSON unchanged.)
- **OpenAPI example generation honours more JSON-Schema constraints** — `minItems`/`maxItems`, string `pattern`,
  `exclusiveMinimum`/`Maximum`, the `time` format, `minProperties`, and `default`/`enum` on format-less
  integer/number schemas. Unconstrained schemas are unchanged.

#### Build & dependencies
- **Stop leaking the vulnerable `commons-beanutils`** (GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9 / CVE-2025-48734) to downstream
  consumers through `velocity-tools-generic` — the 1.11.0 pin lived only in `dependencyManagement` (not
  transitive); it is now excluded from `velocity-tools-generic` and declared directly so the fixed version
  propagates (#1981).

#### Performance under load
- **CPU no longer climbs as the request/event log fills under `/retrieve` and `clear`** (issue #2359, a
  follow-up to #2329). The read paths ran the expensive request matcher on every log entry — including deleted
  tombstones and wrong-type entries — before the cheap type/not-deleted filter, so each `/retrieve` cost grew
  with total log size. The filters are now ordered cheap-predicate-first, and `clear` skips already-deleted
  entries. No behaviour change. Tip for high-throughput users: also clear the log (`?type=LOG`/`ALL` or
  `/reset`), not just expectations, or lower `maxLogEntries`.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

#### Verification
- **Verify responses received from proxied/forwarded systems** — verification now optionally matches the **response** of a recorded request-response exchange, not just the request. Add an `httpResponse` matcher to a verification (`PUT /mockserver/verify` with `{httpRequest?, httpResponse, times}`) and MockServer counts recorded request-response pairs (proxied/forwarded exchanges) whose response matches — by status code, reason phrase (regex), headers, and body (JSON, JSON schema, JSONPath, XML, XPath, regex, etc., reusing the existing request body matchers). When `httpRequest` is also supplied, both must match. `verifySequence` gains an index-aligned `httpResponses` list so an ordered sequence can assert on responses too. The `verify`/`verifySequence` call shape and `VerificationTimes` are unchanged — the presence of a response matcher is what switches verification from "request received" to "response received". When no response matcher is supplied, behaviour is identical to before.

#### Breakpoints & request replay
- **Matcher-driven breakpoints** — breakpoints are toggled per-request via a matcher rather than by global config flags. You register a **request matcher** (works exactly like an expectation request matcher) together with the phases to break at: `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher` with `{httpRequest, phases:["REQUEST"|"RESPONSE"|"RESPONSE_STREAM"|"INBOUND_STREAM"], clientId:"..."}`. A forwarded/proxied exchange whose request matches a registered breakpoint pauses at the selected phase(s). Manage matchers via `GET`/`PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matchers`, `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher/remove` (`{id}`), and `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher/clear`; the registry is cleared on `/mockserver/reset`. The `breakpointTimeoutMillis` (30000) and `breakpointMaxHeld` (50) safety rails are retained.
- **`clientId` required for breakpoint registration; callback WebSocket is the resolution transport** — `PUT /mockserver/breakpoint/matcher` requires a `clientId` field (the callback WebSocket client id); omitting it returns 400. Breakpoints are resolved interactively over the callback WebSocket only — all clients (including the dashboard) resolve breakpoints over that channel.
- **Interactive breakpoint resolution over the callback WebSocket** — a matching forwarded REQUEST or RESPONSE exchange is dispatched to the owning callback-WebSocket client (the same `/_mockserver_callback_websocket` channel `forwardObject`/`responseObject` clients use) for interactive resolution: the client replies with a modified request (forward), a response (abort/replace), or the original (continue). Shares the `breakpointTimeoutMillis` auto-continue and `breakpointMaxHeld` cap rails; a client disconnect removes its breakpoints and auto-continues anything it was holding.
- **Per-frame streaming breakpoints over the callback WebSocket** — RESPONSE_STREAM (outbound) and INBOUND_STREAM (client→server) breakpoints resolve interactively over the callback WebSocket across all nine streaming hold points (SSE/chunked, HTTP/3 gRPC, gRPC server-streaming, WebSocket eager/bidi, GraphQL-subscription, and the WebSocket/GraphQL/gRPC-bidi inbound paths). Two WS message types form the frozen per-frame protocol: a server→client `PausedStreamFrameDTO` (`correlationId`, `streamId`, `sequenceNumber`, `direction`, `phase`, base64 `body`, request method/path) and a client→server `StreamFrameDecisionDTO` (`correlationId`, `action` ∈ CONTINUE/MODIFY/DROP/INJECT/CLOSE, optional base64 `body`). Event-loop safe (decisions marshalled onto the channel event loop, frame bytes copied to `byte[]`), with ordering and backpressure preserved and the shared timeout/max-held rails + client-disconnect auto-continue. The per-server WebSocket registry is injected per-channel (no process-global state).
- **Java client breakpoint API (matcher + callback handlers)** — `MockServerClient.addBreakpoint(matcher, phases…, handlers…)` registers a breakpoint matcher and resolves paused exchanges interactively over the callback WebSocket, with typed handlers per phase: `BreakpointRequestHandler` (return a request to forward/modify or a response to abort), `BreakpointResponseHandler` (return the response to write), and `BreakpointStreamFrameHandler` (return a CONTINUE/MODIFY/DROP/INJECT/CLOSE decision). Plus `listBreakpointMatchers()`, `removeBreakpointMatcher(id)`, `clearBreakpointMatchers()`. The client lazily opens one callback-WS connection (reused across breakpoints) and tears it down on stop/reset. **Per-matcher handler routing:** each pushed paused item carries the matched breakpoint's id (a new `X-MockServer-BreakpointId` header for request/response and a `breakpointId` field on the stream-frame message), so each breakpoint routes to its own handler rather than a single shared per-phase handler. This is the reference API the other language clients mirror.
- **Node, Python & Ruby client breakpoint APIs** — the Node, Python, and Ruby clients gain the same matcher-driven breakpoint API as the Java client (`addBreakpoint`/`add_breakpoint` + convenience overloads, `list`/`remove`/`clear` breakpoint matchers), resolving paused request/response/stream-frame exchanges interactively over each client's existing callback WebSocket with per-matcher handler routing (by the `X-MockServer-BreakpointId` header / `breakpointId` frame field). Idiomatic per language (typed objects in Node, dicts in Python, hashes in Ruby); handlers auto-continue on error or missing handler so a buggy handler can't hang the exchange.
- **Go, .NET & Rust client breakpoint APIs (new callback-WebSocket stacks)** — the Go, .NET, and Rust clients gain a full callback-WebSocket stack (Go `gorilla/websocket`, .NET built-in `ClientWebSocket`, Rust `tungstenite`) plus the matcher-driven breakpoint API (`addBreakpoint`/`AddBreakpoint`/`add_breakpoint` + convenience overloads, list/remove/clear breakpoint matchers). Each connects to `/_mockserver_callback_websocket`, registers a `clientId`, and resolves paused request/response/stream-frame exchanges over the callback WebSocket with per-matcher handler routing, auto-continuing on handler error/panic. Concurrency-safe (serialised WS writes + lazy init; Go verified with `-race`) and reconnect-on-dead-connection. PHP is excluded (no WebSocket support). This completes breakpoint support across seven clients (Java, Node, Python, Ruby, Go, .NET, Rust).
- **Stream frame breakpoints (backend)** — per-frame hold/modify/drop/inject/close for all streaming response types: forwarded SSE/HTTP/1.1 chunked, gRPC server-streaming, WebSocket, GraphQL-subscription, and HTTP/3 gRPC. Each frame is intercepted at its hold point, parked in `StreamFrameBreakpointRegistry`, and resolved over the callback WebSocket. Fully non-blocking (event-loop safe), with backpressure, ordered frame resolution, stream-close eviction, timeout auto-continue, and the shared `breakpointMaxHeld` cap. Activated when a matching `RESPONSE_STREAM` breakpoint matcher is registered (zero overhead otherwise).
- **Inbound (client→server) breakpoints for gRPC bidi over HTTP/3 (QUIC)** — extends `INBOUND_STREAM` breakpoints to bidirectional gRPC streaming over HTTP/3, the QUIC analogue of the HTTP/2 gRPC-bidi inbound path (`Http3GrpcBidiStreamHandler`). Each inbound gRPC DATA frame is parked before decoding and resolved over the callback WebSocket (continue/modify/drop/inject/close); default-off (only when an `INBOUND_STREAM` matcher matches the stream). Because the QUIC driver copies each frame to `byte[]` and releases it before handing off, no `ByteBuf` is held and the QUIC flow-control window is never pinned; per-frame ordering is preserved by dispatching one frame at a time and buffering the rest (bounded by `maxRequestBodySize`). This completes interactive breakpoints across HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.
- **Dashboard Breakpoints panel (callback-WebSocket client)** — the dashboard is a real callback client: it connects to `/_mockserver_callback_websocket` (the server assigns it a `clientId`, since a browser WebSocket can't send the registration header) and resolves paused exchanges live over the callback WebSocket — no REST polling. The panel has three tabs: **Matchers** (register a breakpoint matcher with a method/path matcher + phase checkboxes; list/remove/clear), **Live Exchanges** (paused requests/responses arrive in real time — Continue / Modify the JSON / Abort), and **Live Streams** (paused stream frames — Continue / Modify / Drop / Inject / Close; direction badge distinguishes INBOUND from OUTBOUND frames). A connection-state indicator shows the callback-WS status.
- **Request replay from the dashboard** — a new `PUT /mockserver/replay` control-plane endpoint re-issues a previously recorded/proxied request to its original target and returns the upstream response (reuses the existing `NettyHttpClient`/forward client; 10 MB body-size cap; behind control-plane auth). The dashboard Traffic view gains a Replay button on every selected request that opens a dialog to re-issue the request with one click and inspect the live response. The Java client exposes a typed `replay(HttpRequest)` method wrapping the endpoint.
- **Inbound bidirectional frame breakpoints (backend)** — intercepts client-to-server frames on WebSocket, GraphQL-subscription, and gRPC-bidi connections before MockServer processes them. Each inbound frame is copied to byte[], the original ByteBuf/Http2DataFrame is released immediately (refunding the HTTP/2 flow-control window), and the copy is parked in `StreamFrameBreakpointRegistry` with `direction=INBOUND`. Resolved over the callback WebSocket. Fully non-blocking with backpressure (autoRead paused for WebSocket/GraphQL; pull-based ctx.read() withholding for gRPC-bidi), channel-close eviction. Activated when a matching `INBOUND_STREAM` breakpoint matcher is registered (zero overhead otherwise).

#### OpenAPI
- **Full OpenAPI 3.1 support** — MockServer now fully supports OpenAPI 3.1 specifications, including the three constructs previously documented as partially handled: `type` as an array (e.g. `type: [string, "null"]`) now generates correct example values for the primary non-null type; `$ref` siblings (description alongside `$ref`) are resolved by the parser; and the `webhooks` top-level key is parsed and its operations are included when generating expectations, matching requests, and validating responses. No specification changes or version downgrades are required.

#### Chaos engineering
- **Scheduled multi-stage chaos experiments** — a new `PUT /mockserver/chaosExperiment` endpoint starts an ordered sequence of chaos stages, each applying service-scoped chaos profiles for a configurable duration before automatically advancing to the next stage. Supports looping, status polling via `GET /mockserver/chaosExperiment`, graceful stop via `DELETE /mockserver/chaosExperiment`, and integrates with the C1 auto-halt circuit-breaker (an experiment halts if the safety threshold is exceeded mid-stage). Max 50 stages, 24 h per stage, one active experiment at a time.
- **Chaos auto-halt circuit-breaker** — when enabled (`chaosAutoHaltEnabled=true`), MockServer automatically disables all active service-scoped chaos profiles if the number of chaos-injected errors within a sliding window exceeds a configurable threshold, preventing chaos experiments from causing cascading outages. Reflected in the `mock_server_chaos_auto_halt_total` Prometheus counter and a WARN log event.
- **Dashboard Chaos tab — full HTTP fault-type controls** — the HTTP Service Chaos register/edit form now exposes every `HttpChaosProfile` field: Retry-After header, body truncation fraction, malformed body toggle, slow (dribbled) response chunk size/delay, quota rate-limiting (name/limit/window/error status), degradation ramp, and outage time window — so users can configure the complete fault set without writing JSON.

#### LLM observability & cost control
- **LLM proxy/forward observability** — observability that previously fired only for *mocked* LLM responses now also covers LLM traffic **forwarded/proxied** through MockServer. With `otelTracesEnabled`, MockServer emits a GenAI OpenTelemetry span (provider, model, token usage, finish reason) for forwarded LLM responses, using a new provider sniffer that detects the upstream from the target host (with a path-gated fallback to `llmProvider`); all forward paths (matched-forward, unmatched proxy-pass, breakpoint-continuation) now also emit the generic request span consistently. The agent-run analysis tools (`explain_agent_run`, `verify_tool_call`) accept `provider:"AUTO"` for provider auto-detection from recorded request paths, and the dashboard Sessions view renders the call graph for proxy-only sessions, grouping unscoped traffic by upstream host. Off by default; fully fail-soft (telemetry never affects the forwarded response).
- **LLM token/cost Prometheus metrics** — when `llmMetricsEnabled=true` (alongside `metricsEnabled`), three new Prometheus counters track cumulative LLM token usage and estimated cost across all served and forwarded completions: `mock_server_llm_input_tokens`, `mock_server_llm_output_tokens`, `mock_server_llm_cost_usd`, each labeled by `provider` and `model`. The forward-path response parse is gated on metrics OR tracing OR budget, so token tracking works without requiring full OTLP tracing. Default off to avoid parsing forwarded response bodies unless asked.
- **LLM cost-budget circuit-breaker** — `mockserver.llmCostBudgetUsd` sets a cumulative USD ceiling across all LLM completions (mocked + forwarded). When the running cost total exceeds the budget, unmatched LLM proxy forwards are blocked with a 429 response including the cumulative and budget amounts (mocked LLM responses are never blocked). Deterministic and fail-open (a negative, unset, or malformed budget never blocks traffic). Resets on `HttpState.reset()`. Tracked by the `mock_server_llm_cost_budget_tripped` Prometheus counter.
- **Per-session token/cost totals in Sessions view** — the dashboard Sessions view now displays per-session aggregate token usage (total input/output tokens) and estimated USD cost as chips in each session lane header, computed purely client-side from the already-parsed response bodies.
- **First-class LLM failover/retry scenario builder** — `LlmFailoverBuilder` and the `mock_llm_failover` MCP tool generate an ordered set of expectations that simulate a provider returning failures (e.g. 503, 429) for the first N attempts, then succeeding with a provider-correct `httpLlmResponse`. Uses `Times.exactly(n)` on failure expectations so they are consumed in order before falling through to the unlimited success expectation. Consecutive same-status failures are coalesced for efficiency. Point LiteLLM, Envoy AI Gateway, or an SDK's retry config at MockServer and assert failover logic deterministically.
- **Token-based (TPM/TPD) LLM rate-limit simulation** — `LlmChaosProfile` now supports token-based quota enforcement via `tokenQuotaLimit` and `tokenQuotaWindowMillis`, modelling real provider TPM/TPD limits. Each response's token count (from `Usage` or estimated from text length) is charged against an independent fixed-window counter in `LlmQuotaRegistry`; when the cumulative in-window total exceeds the limit, a 429 (`token_quota_exceeded`) is returned. Both request-count and token quotas can coexist on the same profile.
- **Provider-correct LLM rate-limit response headers** — when MockServer returns a rate-limit or quota error on the LLM response path (probabilistic chaos `errorStatus` or stateful quota 429), it now emits the provider-correct rate-limit HTTP headers that real LLM providers send (OpenAI `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`/`x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`/`x-ratelimit-reset-requests`, Anthropic `anthropic-ratelimit-requests-*` with RFC 3339 timestamps, Gemini/Bedrock `retry-after`). Successful responses also carry the headers when a quota is configured, so client SDK retry/backoff logic can be exercised against a mock. Ollama returns no rate-limit headers (local inference). Implemented by the pure helper `LlmRateLimitHeaders` (`org.mockserver.llm`).

#### Mock creation & matching feedback
- **Generalised capture-to-expectation** — the dashboard "Capture as Mock" dialog now works for **any** recorded or proxied request (plain HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL), not just LLM traffic. A three-level **matcher precision toggle** (Exact / Moderate / Loose) controls how tightly the generated `httpRequest` matcher binds: from method+path+query+headers+body down to method+path only. Generic captures register via `PUT /mockserver/expectation` with `httpResponse`; the existing LLM capture path is unchanged.
- **Create expectation from unmatched request** — the "Why Didn't This Match?" mismatch diagnostic dialog now includes a "Create Expectation" button that opens the capture-as-mock dialog pre-filled with the unmatched request, letting users turn a near-miss into a working stub in one click.
- **Client-visible match feedback** — new opt-in config property `attachMismatchDiagnosticToResponse` (default `false`) attaches closest-match diagnostic info (header `x-mockserver-closest-match` + JSON body with per-field diffs) to 404 responses for unmatched requests, so test authors can see why their mock didn't match without checking the dashboard or logs.
- **Opt-in realistic OpenAPI example data** — new config property `generateRealisticExampleValues` (default `false`) makes OpenAPI example generation produce schema/format-aware values via Datafaker (email, UUID, date, date-time, URI, hostname, IPv4/IPv6, byte, password, integers/numbers respecting min/max) instead of static placeholders, with a fixed seed for deterministic output. Existing behaviour is unchanged when the flag is off.

#### Response templates
- **Templates can be loaded from a file** — `httpResponseTemplate` and `httpForwardTemplate` accept a new `templateFile` field (a classpath-or-filesystem path) as an alternative to the inline `template`, keeping large templates out of the expectation JSON. When both are set the inline `template` takes precedence. Works with all three engines (Velocity, Mustache, JavaScript).
- **Templated response body files** — a static `httpResponse` whose body is a `FILE` body can set a `templateType` of `MUSTACHE` or `VELOCITY`, in which case the file contents are rendered as a template against the request before being returned (the status code, headers and content type still come from the static response). This combines externally stored response bodies (issue #2163) with response templating, as requested in discussion #2350. JavaScript is not supported for body files (its templates return a full response object rather than text) — use `httpResponseTemplate` for that.
- **Client-library support for `templateFile` and templated FILE bodies** — the Node, Python, Go, .NET, Ruby and Rust clients gain `templateFile` on their template models and `templateType` on FILE response bodies, so the two features above can be driven from each client (the PHP client, which has no template model, gains a `fileBody()` helper).
- **Velocity templates are parsed once and cached** — the Velocity engine previously re-parsed the template string on every render. It now caches the parsed template (via Velocity's native string-resource cache) and reuses it, so a repeatedly rendered template (response templating, forward templating, and especially load-scenario steps that render every iteration) is rendered without re-parsing. Output is unchanged. Measured with JMH (`-prof gc`): 55–79% faster and 46–74% less allocation per render across simple-to-complex templates, with the biggest wins on complex templates under sustained load.
- **Velocity render allocates less per request** — the stateless built-in template functions and helpers (`$uuid`, `$faker`, `$json`, etc.) are now shared across renders via a single immutable context layer instead of being copied into a fresh context on every render. Request-scoped state (the request, the per-iteration values, and request-scoped tools like `$json`/`$xml`) is still built fresh per render, so output and thread-safety are unchanged. Measured with JMH: a further ~1 KB/op less allocation and 30–67% faster per render on top of the parse-once caching above.

#### Dashboard & UI
- **Editable runtime config in the dashboard** — the Configuration dialog now exposes editable controls for `devMode`, `generateRealisticExampleValues`, `attachMismatchDiagnosticToResponse`, `validateProxyOpenAPISpec`, `validateProxyEnforce`, `chaosAutoHaltEnabled`, `chaosAutoHaltErrorThreshold`, and `chaosAutoHaltWindowMillis` (booleans as switches, strings and numbers as text/number fields), driven by a declarative descriptor list in `configuration.ts`. Existing `logLevel`/`detailedMatchFailures`/`metricsEnabled` controls are unchanged; properties not in the descriptor list remain visible read-only.
- **Dashboard Composer — template snippet palette** — the Response Template and Forward Template panels now include an "Insert snippet" button that opens a categorised palette of curated template snippets (request echoes, dynamic data, structure patterns). The palette is engine-aware, showing the correct Velocity / Mustache / JavaScript syntax for the selected template engine and including a live preview of each snippet's output.
- **Dashboard Composer — multi-language code preview** — the Review step's read-only code preview now generates idiomatic client snippets for **Node.js, Python, Go, C#, Ruby and Rust** alongside Java, with JSON and curl shown last. Each client-library tab hydrates the same expectation JSON through that client's native facility (Node `mockAnyResponse`, Python `Expectation.from_dict`, Go/Rust deserialize-and-`Upsert`, C# `Deserialize<Expectation>`, Ruby `Expectation.from_hash`), so every action type is representable without reimplementing each language's builder API. The Composer also gains a "Load template from file" field on the template panels and a "Body source: from file" option (with an optional template engine) on the static-response panel, surfacing the `templateFile` and templated-FILE-body features.
- **Dashboard Library view — Import tab** — the Library view now opens on an Import tab (alongside Export) that lets users paste, upload, or URL-import specs and collections directly from the dashboard (Expectation JSON, OpenAPI, WSDL, HAR, Postman), wiring to the existing server endpoints without any new backend changes.
- **Dashboard "Get Started" onboarding panel** — new users land on a guided first-run view with action cards to import an OpenAPI spec, set up proxy recording, try docker-compose quick-start recipes, and explore the dashboard docs. The view is the default when no expectations or traffic exist; it auto-transitions to the dashboard once data arrives and remains accessible via the nav bar.
- **Dashboard request diffing from the Traffic view** — a "Compare" toggle in the Traffic inspector lets you pick two recorded or proxied requests and open the field-level diff inline (reusing the existing `PUT /mockserver/diff` endpoint and diff dialog), pre-populated with the two selected requests.
- **LLM streaming-physics controls in the Composer** — the conversation builder now exposes streaming-physics fields (time-to-first-token, tokens-per-second, jitter) when a turn is marked as streaming, so users can shape the timing of mocked streamed completions without hand-writing the `streaming` block.
- **LLM structured-output field in the Composer** — the conversation builder now has an `outputSchema` field so a mocked completion can declare a JSON schema for structured/tool-style output.
- **WASM rule body matcher in the Composer** — the expectation Composer now offers a `wasm` body-matcher option with a module-name dropdown sourced from the uploaded WASM modules, so a custom WASM rule can be wired into an expectation from the dashboard (it previously could only be uploaded, not referenced).
- **Chaos auto-halt controls in the Chaos tab** — the dashboard Chaos tab now surfaces the auto-halt circuit-breaker inline (arm/disarm switch, error threshold, and sliding-window size) so users can see and adjust the safety cut-off where they configure chaos, rather than only in the Configuration dialog.

#### CLI & self-contained binary
- **Redesigned command-line interface** — a `mockserver` CLI (built on picocli) with `run` (default), `proxy`, `openapi`, `version` and `help` subcommands, per-command `--help`, short flags (`-p`/`--port`, `--proxy-to`, `--openapi`, `--init`, `--persist`, `-l`/`--log-level`) and scheme-aware proxy targets (`--proxy-to https://host` infers the port). The `org.mockserver.cli.Main` entry point, all existing flags (`-serverPort`, `-proxyRemotePort`, `-proxyRemoteHost`, `-logLevel`) and the configuration precedence (command line > system property > environment variable > properties file) remain fully supported. Documented in `docs/code/cli.md` and the *Running MockServer* site page.
- **CLI validation-proxy flags** — `--validate-openapi <spec>` and `--validate-enforce` on the `run` and `proxy` subcommands let users launch a validating proxy in one command, wiring directly to the existing `validateProxyOpenAPISpec` / `validateProxyEnforce` configuration properties.
- **Developer-friendly `--dev` mode** — opt-in `--dev` CLI flag (or `MOCKSERVER_DEV_MODE=true` / `-Dmockserver.devMode=true`) applies laptop-appropriate defaults: `maxLogEntries=1000` and `maxExpectations=1000`, reducing memory usage for local development and test suites. Explicit configuration always overrides dev-mode defaults. Default behaviour (without `--dev`) is completely unchanged.
- **`ui` subcommand** — `mockserver ui [-p <port>]` starts MockServer (default port 1080) and opens the dashboard (`/mockserver/dashboard`) in the default browser, printing the URL and degrading gracefully to just the URL on a headless host (server/CI/SSH). To start without opening a browser, use `run`.
- **`-D<key>=<value>` CLI property passthrough** — `run`/`ui`/`proxy`/`openapi` accept repeatable `-D` options (e.g. `mockserver run -p 1080 -Dmockserver.metricsEnabled=true`), applied as JVM system properties before startup, so the launcher and jar can set any configuration property without a JVM `-D` before `-jar`.
- **Clearer CLI errors & help** — starting without a resolvable port (no `-p`/`--port`, `MOCKSERVER_SERVER_PORT`, `mockserver.serverPort`, or properties file) now prints a concise picocli usage plus a one-line actionable error instead of the legacy `java -jar …` block and an empty configuration dump. Usage text reflects how MockServer was launched (`mockserver …` from the binary bundle, `java -jar …` otherwise), and `-help`/`-version` now behave the same as `--help`/`--version` (top-level overview).
- **Self-contained binary distribution (no JVM, no Docker)** — every release now publishes downloadable MockServer bundles (a jlink-trimmed Java runtime + the server + a `mockserver` launcher) for Linux, macOS and Windows (x86_64 + aarch64) as assets on the GitHub Release, each with a SHA-256. Download, extract, and run `bin/mockserver run -p 1080` — no pre-installed JVM or Docker required. Built from one host via `scripts/build-binary-bundle.sh` / `scripts/build-all-bundles.sh`.
- **`mockserver-node` binary launcher** — `npx -p mockserver-node mockserver run -p 1080` downloads the JVM-less binary bundle for the current platform (no Java, no Docker), verifies its SHA-256, caches it per-user, and runs it. Honours `MOCKSERVER_BINARY_BASE_URL` (mirror), `MOCKSERVER_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD`, `MOCKSERVER_BINARY_CACHE` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Reference implementation of the on-demand-binary pattern for the client libraries.

#### Client libraries & integrations
- **Multi-language client libraries** — hand-written idiomatic clients for the MockServer control plane in **Go** (`mockserver-client-go`, pkg.go.dev), **.NET** (`MockServerClient`, NuGet), **Rust** (`mockserver-client`, crates.io) and **PHP** (`mock-server/mockserver-client`, Packagist), covering create-expectation, verify/verifySequence, clear, reset and retrieve. Each ships unit tests plus a skippable integration test.
- **Testcontainers modules** — a `MockServerContainer` for **Node**, **Python**, **.NET**, **Go** and **Rust** (under `mockserver-testcontainers/`) that starts the `mockserver/mockserver` image, waits on `/mockserver/status` and exposes the mapped URL.
- **Editor integrations** — a **VS Code** extension (`mockserver-vscode`: start/stop the Docker container, open the dashboard, expectation snippets) and an initial **JetBrains/IntelliJ Platform** plugin scaffold (`mockserver-jetbrains`).

#### Packaging & distribution channels
- **GHCR image mirror** — every release now mirrors the multi-arch images to `ghcr.io/mock-server/mockserver` (copied from Docker Hub by digest, cosign-signed). Error-isolated: a GHCR failure never affects the Docker Hub / ECR publish.
- **Automated MCP registry publishing** — the release pipeline publishes `server.json` to `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io` under the DNS-verified `com.mock-server/mockserver` namespace (non-interactive auth via an ed25519 key in Secrets Manager + an apex TXT record). Soft-fail — never blocks a release.
- **Release pipeline distribution channels** — soft-fail release components that publish the new clients, Testcontainers modules and editor extensions (NuGet, crates.io, Packagist, pkg.go.dev, npm, PyPI, VS Code Marketplace / Open VSX, JetBrains Marketplace), with post-release liveness checks.
- **`mockserver-bom` (Bill of Materials)** — a new published artifact consumers can import into their `dependencyManagement` to pin every MockServer module **and** every third-party dependency MockServer relies on to a single, mutually consistent version. This makes downstream builds reproducible and satisfies strict version-alignment checks such as the Maven Enforcer `dependencyConvergence` rule, which previously flagged the differing transitive versions MockServer resolves internally (via its parent POM's `dependencyManagement`) but did not export to consumers. Usage: import `org.mock-server:mockserver-bom` with `<type>pom</type>` and `<scope>import</scope>`.

- **One-command quick-start recipes** — curated `docker compose up` recipes under `examples/docker-compose/` for the most common use cases (`mock-from-openapi`, `record-replay-proxy`, `validation-proxy`, `chaos-proxy`), each self-contained with a short README and a "Getting started in 60 seconds" path in the repository README.
- **Consolidated "Self-Hosting MockServer" guide** — a single task-oriented site page (`/mock_server/self_hosting_mockserver.html`) that brings together every way to run MockServer yourself with copy-paste commands: Docker and the one-command docker-compose recipes, the `mockserver` CLI and the JVM-less binary bundle, Helm/Kubernetes, the executable JAR, Testcontainers, initializers/persistence, and bootstrapping from a browser HAR. Linked from the repository README.
- **MockServer UI docs — Traffic compare/diff and full Chaos fault set** — the *MockServer UI* site page (`/mock_server/mockserver_ui.html`) now documents the Traffic view's "Compare" toggle for diffing two captured requests (`PUT /mockserver/diff`) and the Chaos tab's complete HTTP service-chaos fault set wired to `PUT /mockserver/serviceChaos` (error/connection faults, body corruption, slow-response chunking, quota/rate limit, count and time windows, gradual degradation, GraphQL error envelope, and TTL).

### Changed

- **CI** — the build pipeline now runs unit tests for the new Go, .NET, Rust and PHP libraries, the five Testcontainers modules and the editor extensions (each in its language toolchain Docker image), triggered by changes under their paths.
- **Slimmer `mockserver-client-java` classpath** — the Java client no longer drags the server-only engines (Velocity/Mustache templating, GraalVM JavaScript, WASM/Chicory, DataFaker, protobuf/gRPC transcoding **and the Swagger/OpenAPI parser**) onto a consumer's classpath when it is the only MockServer artifact depended upon. Those all run inside the server, never in the client JVM, so they are excluded from the client's `mockserver-core` dependency. `mockserver-core`'s object mapper now registers its Swagger-coupled serializers only when swagger-core is present (see Fixed), so the client serialises OpenAPI expectations as plain spec strings without the parser on its classpath. In-process-server usages (e.g. `mockserver-junit-jupiter` → `mockserver-netty`) are unaffected — the engines still arrive via the server module. Verified by the full 155-test client suite, 718 core serialization/OpenAPI tests, and a runtime check that round-trips expectations with swagger genuinely absent.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard rendered a blank page when the server ran on a non-UTF-8 platform** ([#2347](https://github.com/mock-server/mockserver-monorepo/issues/2347)) — the dashboard's static assets (JS/CSS/HTML) are always written to the wire as UTF-8, but the `Content-Length` header was computed with the JVM's default charset. On a platform whose default charset is not UTF-8 (e.g. Windows, where the legacy default is `windows-1252`), any asset containing multi-byte characters got a `Content-Length` shorter than the actual body, so the browser truncated the bundle and the dashboard showed a white page. A JAR built on macOS (UTF-8) therefore worked there but failed on Windows. `Content-Length` is now computed from the UTF-8 byte length, matching the bytes sent.
- **Diagnostic match endpoints flooded the dashboard log with spurious unmatched entries** — the "Why Didn't This Match?" debug-mismatch path and the `explain_unmatched_requests` MCP tool re-ran the live request matchers purely to compute field-level diffs, but that match wrote one `EXPECTATION_NOT_MATCHED` event per expectation into the event log as a side-effect. Those entries had no request correlationId, so the dashboard could not group them, and repeated calls filled the bounded dashboard log window and evicted matched/response/received entries — making the dashboard appear to show only unmatched traffic. Read-only diagnostics now suppress match-result logging (a request-scoped flag on `MatchDifference`), so they no longer mutate the log they inspect.
- **Dashboard Library → Import format radios mis-aligned** — the format radio buttons (Expectation JSON / OpenAPI / WSDL / HAR / Postman) now top-align with their option titles instead of centring on the whole title+description block.
- **Dashboard Composer connection-options row clipping/overlap** — in the response "Connection options (advanced)" row the "Content-Length override" field no longer clips its label and the "Close socket" dropdown arrow no longer overlaps the text; the "Suppress Content-Length"/"Suppress Connection" switches now have clear spacing from the override field instead of crowding it.
- **Build-time guard for global-state-mutating tests missing from sequential Surefire phase** — added `GlobalStateMutationGuardTest` that scans all test classes for high-signal static-state mutation patterns (`ConfigurationProperties` setter calls, `System.setProperty`/`clearProperty`, singleton `.getInstance().reset()`/`.clear()`, `Metrics.resetAdditionalMetricsForTesting`, `PrometheusRegistry.defaultRegistry`) and fails the build if any matched class is not in the sequential phase. Moved 17 test classes that were running in the parallel phase despite mutating global state to sequential (with symmetric exclude/include, validated by `ParallelStaticStateGuardTest`). This closes the gap where `ParallelStaticStateGuardTest` only checked list symmetry but could not detect a new stateful test missing from both lists — the root cause of 4 separate CI flake incidents.
- **LLM config-mutating tests flake under parallel Surefire** — `LlmBackendResolverTest`, `LlmProviderSnifferTest`, and `ForwardPathGenAiSpansTest` mutate JVM-global `ConfigurationProperties.llm*` statics but were not in the sequential Surefire phase, causing intermittent cross-test contamination under `parallel=classes`. Moved all three to the sequential phase (symmetric exclude/include lists, validated by `ParallelStaticStateGuardTest`).
- **Chaos auto-halt unbounded accumulation when threshold is non-positive** — when `chaosAutoHaltEnabled=true` but `chaosAutoHaltErrorThreshold` was 0 or negative, `recordError()` appended timestamps to the sliding window without ever evicting them (the early-return skipped eviction but ran after the `addLast`). The threshold check now runs before recording, so a non-positive threshold is a no-op (no timestamps accumulated, no halt). Also removed dead `Sparkline.tsx` component (zero production imports) and corrected stale consumer docs that said gRPC-bidi inbound breakpoints were "not yet intercepted (future work)" — they shipped in `a8f4bb0e2`.
- **Dashboard Chaos/Composer polish + demo Experiments** — the Chaos → Experiments stage fields (Error status, Error prob, Latency ms, Drop prob) were widened so their labels are no longer truncated; the Composer "Editing … changes update this expectation." info box now vertically centres its text with the (i) icon; the operating-mode (SPY/SIMULATE/CAPTURE) dropdown tooltip suppresses itself while the menu is open so it no longer overlays the menu items; and the demo-data populate script (`npm run demo`) now registers a multi-stage looping chaos experiment so the Chaos → Experiments section shows live data out of the box.
- **Dashboard correctness and UX fixes** — a batch of dashboard fixes: the action-type / LLM-provider filter chips are now labelled "expectations only" so they no longer look like a no-op on the request and traffic panels; request-panel row numbers are correct while a search filter is active (numbered against the filtered list, not the full list); the "Generate Stub" dialog now shows **all** returned suggestions instead of silently keeping only the first; panel count chips show the post-filter count (e.g. `2 / 50`) when a filter or search is active; clearing server logs no longer blanks the local expectations/recorded lists without refetching them; panel search now matches field values rather than serialised JSON keys (so searching `value`/`id`/`type` no longer matches every row); the ⌘L "clear logs" shortcut now asks for confirmation like the menu action; copy-to-clipboard failures surface a "Copy failed" tooltip instead of failing silently; the dashboard honours a `?secure=true|false` query-param override so it can target an HTTPS MockServer when itself served over HTTP; the Traffic "Replay" dialog warns that it makes a real, side-effecting call to the original target (with an extra warning for non-GET methods); and the Drift, Breakpoints and Chaos panels degrade gracefully (an "unavailable on this server" notice) instead of showing a raw error when pointed at an older MockServer that lacks those endpoints. Editing an existing LLM conversation and changing the number of turns no longer leaves a duplicate orphaned scenario on the server — the old turns are now cleared before the replacement is registered, and the action is clearly labelled as a replacement. The dashboard service-chaos form now validates `errorStatus` (100–599) and `errorProbability` (0.0–1.0) inline and blocks submission of out-of-range values rather than failing with a server 400.
- **Dashboard adversarial-review correctness fixes (batch 1)** — five defensive fixes from a full adversarial review of the dashboard UI: (1) the Breakpoints panel held paused exchanges in an **unbounded** list that was never cleared on reconnect, so a broad breakpoint matcher (e.g. path `.*`) could exhaust browser memory — the list is now capped (oldest dropped) and cleared when the callback WebSocket disconnects, since held items reference a clientId the server replaces on reconnect; (2) the SSE parser split only on `\n`, so real CRLF-terminated streams mishandled the `[DONE]` sentinel and leaked stray carriage returns into reassembled text — line endings are now normalised first; (3) the Prometheus metrics parser retained non-finite (`+Inf`/`-Inf`/`NaN`) sample values that poisoned chart auto-scaling and numeric formatting (`toFixed` → `"Infinity"`) — non-finite values are now skipped (histogram `le="+Inf"` is unaffected, as it lives in the label, not the value); (4) the TCP and gRPC service-chaos TTL countdowns decremented against the HTTP poll's timestamp (a different poll loop that kept advancing while those sections were collapsed and their data frozen), making the countdowns drift — each dataset now tracks its own poll timestamp; (5) the Traffic detail pane is wrapped in an error boundary so a parser exception on a malformed captured body shows an inline error instead of unmounting the whole inspector.
- **Dashboard Composer round-trip + validation fixes (batch 2)** — editing an existing expectation in the Mocks composer silently lost some body matchers: a **GraphQL** matcher was read back from the non-existent JSON field `graphql` instead of `query` (the actual wire field), so the query was wiped on every edit; and a **WASM** body matcher had no read-back branch at all, so it fell through to a raw JSON dump. Both now round-trip correctly (covered by a new reader↔writer round-trip test). In addition, the Register button now validates **base64** inline for the binary body matcher, the Error action's response bytes, and the Binary response action — malformed base64 is blocked with a clear reason instead of failing as an opaque server 400 (or throwing in the generated Java `Base64.getDecoder().decode(...)`).
- **Dashboard performance fixes (batch 3)** — three rendering/polling efficiency fixes from the adversarial UI review: (1) the **Log Messages** panel re-ran its grouped-entry text computation for every log group on every ~1/sec WebSocket snapshot because `LogGroup` was not memoised and received a fresh per-row toggle closure — it's now `React.memo`-wrapped and the panel passes a single stable toggle callback, so unchanged groups skip the work; (2) all interval-**polling** views (Metrics, Drift, Chaos, Breakpoints, AsyncAPI) now **pause while the browser tab is hidden** and resume on return, instead of scraping/parsing in the background indefinitely (with an in-flight guard so returning to the tab can't fork a duplicate poll loop); (3) the **Traffic** inspector caches each captured request's parsed summary (SSE reassembly + base64 decode) keyed on the item reference, so it no longer re-parses every row on every snapshot and every search keystroke.
- **Dashboard accessibility fixes (batch 4a)** — keyboard and screen-reader fixes from the adversarial UI review: the expand/collapse chevrons on log entries, request/expectation rows, log groups, and match-failure ("because") sections are now real focusable controls with `aria-label` (Expand/Collapse) and `aria-expanded`, so they are keyboard-operable and announce their state (previously they were unlabelled icons inside mouse-only rows); the AppBar clear/reset button gained an `aria-label`; the connection-error banner and notification toasts are now `role="alert"` live regions; and ten Tools-menu dialogs (Clock, Configuration, OIDC, CRUD, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI/WSDL import, Pact, Explain-unmatched, Generate-stub) now expose an accessible name via `aria-labelledby`.
- **Dashboard destructive-action confirmations + dialog reset (batch 4b)** — bulk/irreversible dashboard actions that previously fired on a single click now route through the existing confirmation dialog: clear-all breakpoint matchers (which orphans paused exchanges), clear-all HTTP/TCP/gRPC service chaos, clear drift records, delete a server-filesystem file, and delete a WASM module / clear gRPC descriptors. Per-item Remove on low-stakes lists is unchanged. Separately, several Tools-menu dialogs (AsyncAPI, OIDC, CRUD, File store, and a stale-error clear on Clock/Configuration) now reset their form fields and success/error banners on close, so reopening no longer shows stale pasted content or outcome messages.
- **Dashboard Composer generated-Java formatting (batch 6)** — the "Forward with override" action produced badly mis-indented Java in the Composer's Java preview (the inner `request()` landed at column 0 with its builder calls jammed far to the right) because the override block was indented once when built and again by the outer re-indent pass. It now emits cleanly nested, consistently-indented Java. Added a compile-time exhaustiveness guard to the action-to-Java generator so a future action type can't silently emit `undefined`.
- **Dashboard text-clipping / truncation fixes (batch 7)** — across the dense data views, values that were silently clipped with no way to read the full text now ellipsis-truncate with a tooltip showing the complete value, via a new reusable `TruncatedText` component. Sites fixed: the Breakpoints panel's stream-frame body (which was double-truncated — cut to 40 chars *and* CSS-clipped) plus its id / clientId / matcher / stream-id cells (full UUIDs now recoverable), the Sessions request chips / lane headers / token-cost chips, the Drift expected/actual value cells, the Traffic master-list host+path, the Conversation model/predicate chips, and the collapsed log-entry summary. Also added `minWidth:0` flex fixes so a long host/FQDN in the service-chaos rows and the filter panel no longer forces controls to wrap.
- **Dashboard Composer feature completeness (batch 8)** — the Mocks composer can now author expectation fields that previously could only be set via JSON/the API (and were silently dropped when editing such an expectation in place): a **static response delay**, **reason phrase**, and **response cookies**; a dedicated **JSON body matcher** with a **STRICT / all-matching-fields** match type; and a **substring** toggle for string body matchers. Each is wired through the form, the Java/JSON/curl preview, and the edit-existing round-trip, with the correct server field names. Editing an existing JSON-body expectation stored in the server's default form (a bare JSON object) now correctly comes back as a JSON matcher instead of an exact string.
- **Dashboard responsive form layouts** — the dense multi-field forms that previously went ragged and clipped on narrow viewports now reflow cleanly: the HTTP/TCP/gRPC service-chaos register & edit forms, and the Composer's chaos and side-effect panels, lay their fields out in a responsive CSS grid (`auto-fit` equal columns) instead of fixed-width flex-wrap rows, so columns stay aligned and fields fill the available width at any size. The AppBar's 12-view toggle strip now scrolls horizontally as a unit on narrow windows instead of wrapping mid-group.
- **Dashboard review polish** — four UI fixes from a full review pass: the "Diff two requests" dialog now shows the **diff result at the top** (above the editable request JSON) so it's the most visible thing, and **runs the diff automatically** when opened from the Traffic inspector's Compare flow (both requests already selected) instead of requiring a second button press; the Mocks composer's **Body type** dropdown is wider so "String (exact / subString)" is no longer truncated; and the **Sessions** view now shows a collapsible **Conversation** transcript per session (reusing the Traffic tab's provider chat-bubble views, rendering the last request in the session which carries the full accumulated message history), with a compact **Show Mermaid** link beneath it that opens the correlated agent-run call graph on demand.
- **ReDoS in the Ruby client binary launcher** (CodeQL `rb/polynomial-redos`, CWE-1333) — the trailing-slash strip in `BinaryLauncher.asset_url` used `base.sub(%r{/+\z}, '')`, whose `/+\z` sub-expression can restart at every `/` and backtrack quadratically on a base URL with a long slash run that doesn't end in `/` (relevant on Ruby < 3.2, which lacks the regex match cache). The base URL is operator-supplied via `MOCKSERVER_BINARY_BASE_URL`, so real-world exploitability is low. The trailing-slash strip is now done with a single linear non-regex scan (the regex is removed entirely), eliminating the ReDoS surface — an earlier attempt that merely anchored the regex with a negative look-behind (`%r{(?<!/)/+\z}`) kept the strip linear but did not clear the CodeQL alert. Behaviour is unchanged; added regression tests for interior-slash preservation and a 100k-slash pathological input.
- **Parallel-test isolation for new singleton tests + post-review polish for streaming breakpoints and chaos experiments** — moved `StreamFrameBreakpointRegistryTest`, `ChaosExperimentOrchestratorTest`, and `BreakpointRegistryTest` into the sequential Surefire phase (they mutate JVM-global singletons and flaked under `parallel=classes`); added a `default` case to the stream-frame decision switch in `NettyResponseWriter` to prevent unrecognised actions from hanging the stream; moved `streamId`/`reqMethod`/`reqPath` allocation inside the `streamBreakpointsActive` guard for zero overhead on the default-off path; added `lastTerminatedStatus` to `ChaosExperimentOrchestrator` so `getStatus()` reports `completed`/`stopped`/`halted_by_auto_halt` after an experiment ends; added stream breakpoint and chaos experiment endpoints to the OpenAPI spec; added consumer-facing docs for chaos experiments; fixed the BreakpointsPanel response "Path / Reason" column to show `'-'` instead of the request path when `reasonPhrase` is absent.
- **Startup crash when a properties file has entries** ([#2338](https://github.com/mock-server/mockserver-monorepo/issues/2338)) — MockServer 7.0.0 failed to start with `NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.mockserver.configuration.ConfigurationProperties` (caused by a `NullPointerException` during static initialisation) whenever a `mockserver.properties` file — or the Helm chart's `app.config.properties` — contained any entries. The startup property-dump redaction added in 7.0.0 read its `SENSITIVE_SUBSTRINGS` set from the `PROPERTIES` static initialiser but declared it ~3000 lines later in the class, so it was still `null` when class initialisation ran (a static-init ordering bug). The redaction fields are now initialised before the property file is read, with a regression test that initialises `ConfigurationProperties` afresh against a populated property file.
- **Downstream `dependencyConvergence` failures** — consuming MockServer (e.g. `mockserver-client-java` with `MockServerContainer`) under the Maven Enforcer `dependencyConvergence` rule failed with multiple version-conflict errors, because MockServer's transitive version pins lived in the parent POM's `dependencyManagement`, which Maven does not export to consumers. Three changes address this: a new **`mockserver-bom`** to import (above); the slimmer client classpath (above); and pruning the stale `velocity-engine-core 2.3` that `velocity-tools-generic` dragged in alongside the `2.4.1` the build already uses (all 21 Velocity engine tests still pass). With the BOM imported, a client-only consumer's convergence errors drop from 17 to 0.
- **Latent undefined `${jetty.version}` in the parent POM** — three Jetty HTTP-client `dependencyManagement` entries referenced a `jetty.version` property that was only ever defined in the `examples/java` module, so the managed versions were unresolved for any other consumer of the published parent POM. The dead entries were removed from the parent and the `examples` module now declares its Jetty client versions explicitly.
- **Object mapper Swagger coupling made optional** — `ObjectMapperFactory` registered its Swagger/OpenAPI-coupled serializers (the schema serializers and the OpenAPI-derived `HttpRequestsPropertiesMatcher` serializer) unconditionally, so initialising the object mapper loaded `io.swagger.v3.oas.models.*` even on a client that never produces those objects. They are now isolated in a `SwaggerSerializers` helper and registered only when swagger-core is on the classpath, which is what lets `mockserver-client-java` exclude the Swagger/OpenAPI parser (eliminating the bulk of a client-only consumer's remaining `dependencyConvergence` conflicts). The single `com.github.fge` (json-tools) pretty-print call on the client-reachable path was replaced with a small `JsonPrettyPrinter`, and `jackson-datatype-jsr310` — used directly by the object mapper but previously only arriving transitively via the Swagger parser — is now a direct `mockserver-core` dependency. Server behaviour is unchanged (swagger-core is always present there).
- **Remaining non-Swagger convergence conflicts pruned** — with the Swagger parser excluded from the client, three transitive version splits remained for a client-only consumer: `slf4j-api` (older versions via `java-uuid-generator`, `json-path` and `com.networknt:json-schema-validator`), `jackson-annotations` (2.21 via the validator's Jackson 3 transitive) and `jakarta.xml.bind-api` (2.3.3 via `xmlunit-core`). `mockserver-core` now excludes those stale transitive edges; in every case it already declares the winning version directly (`slf4j-api` 2.0.18, `jackson-annotations` 2.22, `jakarta.xml.bind-api` 4.0.5), so its own resolved classpath is unchanged (255 XML/JSON-schema/JSON-path core tests still pass). A consumer depending only on `mockserver-client-java` now passes the Maven Enforcer `dependencyConvergence` rule with **zero** errors even without importing the BOM.

### Documentation

- **Interactive Breakpoints guide rewritten for the matcher + callback-WebSocket model** — the *Interactive Breakpoints* consumer page now documents the final feature: registering a request matcher with phases, resolving paused request/response/stream-frame exchanges interactively over the callback WebSocket (with the per-frame `PausedStreamFrameDTO`/`StreamFrameDecisionDTO` protocol and the `X-MockServer-BreakpointId` routing), the dashboard Breakpoints panel, the safety rails, and idiomatic examples for all seven supported clients (Java, Node, Python, Ruby, Go, .NET, Rust — PHP is not supported). The OpenAPI spec carries `clientId` on the matcher endpoints, and `docs/code/breakpoints.md` was consolidated (TL;DR + flow diagram, WS-callback-only resolution).
- **New consumer guides for the newest features** — added three site pages: *LLM Response Mocking* (`/mock_server/llm_response_mocking.html`) showing how to mock OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Bedrock / Azure OpenAI / Ollama responses via plain expectations — including conversations, streaming and cost budgets — without needing an AI agent or MCP; *Interactive Breakpoints* (`/mock_server/interactive_breakpoints.html`) walking through pausing, inspecting, modifying and resuming requests/responses; and *Observability* (`/mock_server/observability.html`) covering Prometheus metrics (including LLM token/cost counters) and OpenTelemetry trace export with W3C context propagation. Each is linked into the site navigation.
- **Consumer doc corrections** — corrected the *HTTPS & TLS* page to state the real default TLS protocols (`TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2`, not "TLS 1.2 and 1.3"), matching the configuration-properties page; clarified that `disableLogging` disables **all** logging (not just system-out) on the *Performance* page; fixed the *Running MockServer* meta description ("Grunt", not "Gradle"); noted that the Kubernetes `httpGet` liveness probe example requires `MOCKSERVER_LIVENESS_HTTP_GET_PATH` to be set (the path is off by default); reordered *Getting Started* so the common-path "Next Steps" precede the upgrade notes; and simplified the configuration-property precedence wording. Also corrected the internal `docs/code/configuration-reference.md` precedence order (properties file beats environment variable) to match the code.
- **Internal docs** — added `docs/code/chaos.md` (chaos experiments: ChaosExperimentOrchestrator, ordered stages, looping, auto-halt integration, safety limits, endpoints); documented `PUT /mockserver/replay` (request replay) and `PUT/GET/DELETE /mockserver/chaosExperiment` in `docs/code/request-processing.md`; updated `docs/code/dashboard-ui.md` to reflect twelve views (Breakpoints + Get-Started), the Breakpoints panel (request/response/stream phases), the Get-Started onboarding view, Traffic-view Replay and Compare buttons, and the Composer snippet palette; added `generateRealisticExampleValues`/`SampleDataGenerator` coverage to `docs/code/domain-model.md`; added `chaos.md` and `breakpoints.md` rows to `docs/README.md`; added chaos.md and broadened breakpoints row in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Internal docs corrections** — corrected `docs/code/breakpoints.md`: removed stale "Future work" section (all four items shipped — HTTP/3-gRPC, gRPC-bidi inbound, and both dashboard UI features); added `GrpcBidiStreamHandler.handleData` and `GrpcBidiRouterHandler` to the Inbound frame breakpoints key-classes; updated `docs/README.md` doc counts (code: 21→24, operations: 13→15); replaced "error-class" with "destructive" in `docs/code/metrics.md` to match `ChaosAutoHaltMonitor.DESTRUCTIVE_FAULT_TYPES`; updated `docs/code/dashboard-ui.md` Streams tab description to reflect the shipped direction badge and gRPC-bidi inbound frames; added three missing code-doc rows (`ai-protocol-mocking.md`, `llm-codec-fixtures.md`, `llm-security-audit.md`) to the `AGENTS.md` reference table.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-06-06

This cycle centres on **first-class LLM / AI-agent mocking** and a major **platform modernisation**, alongside broader resilience-testing and dashboard improvements. Highlights (see the per-item entries below for detail):

- **HTTP/3 streaming responses** — SSE, chunked proxy forwarding, and LLM streaming are now fully supported over HTTP/3 (QUIC). Each body chunk is sent as an HTTP/3 DATA frame with backpressure via `StreamingBody.requestMore()`; the QUIC stream is cleanly shut down on completion or error. Bundled native QUIC removes the need for a separately downloaded BoringSSL library.
- **TPROXY (IP_TRANSPARENT) transparent proxy** — a new default-off `transparentProxyTproxy` configuration property enables `IP_TRANSPARENT` socket binding so that with iptables TPROXY rules the kernel preserves the original destination as the listening socket's local address, which MockServer reads via `channel.localAddress()` — avoiding the conntrack `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` lookup used with REDIRECT rules. Requires Linux, `epoll` transport, and `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. Verified end-to-end with a real Docker `NET_ADMIN` integration test.
- **Testcontainers 1.21.4** — upgrades from 1.20.6, fixing `DockerClientFactory.isDockerAvailable()` returning `false` on Docker Desktop 4.67 / Engine API 1.54 (docker-java 3.4.2 probe fix).
- **Clustered MockServer state (opt-in)** — a new `mockserver-state-infinispan` module provides an embedded Infinispan `StateBackend` that can replicate expectations and scenario state across a JGroups cluster. Single-node behaviour is completely unchanged (the in-memory `StateBackend` remains the default). New configuration properties: `stateBackend`, `clusterEnabled`, `clusterName`, `clusterTransportConfig`, `blobStoreType`.
- **LLM / AI-agent mocking suite** — provider-correct mock completions and streaming for seven providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama), with embeddings for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI; multi-turn scripted conversations with per-session isolation and deterministic prompt normalisation; and a runtime-LLM client SPI (off unless configured, fails closed) that powers the opt-in features. A broad MCP toolset drives it from an agent: `mock_llm_completion`, `create_llm_conversation`, `verify_tool_call`, `explain_agent_run` (with a correlated call graph), `verify_structured_output`, `verify_cost_budget`, `detect_llm_drift`, `mock_adversarial_llm_response`, and `run_mcp_contract_test`.
- **Agent resilience & correctness testing** — structured-output (JSON-Schema) validation on both the response path (`outputSchema`, fail-soft) and the verification path (`verify_structured_output`); a deterministic CI **cost-budget gate** (`verify_cost_budget`) over a built-in pricing table; declarative **LLM fault/chaos profiles** (probabilistic provider errors, mid-stream truncation, malformed SSE) plus a **stateful request-quota** rate limit; VCR record/replay with strict mode and body/header redaction; a prompt-injection / adversarial-response harness; and OpenTelemetry GenAI span + metrics export. The dashboard surfaces all of it (conversation wizard, sessions & call-graph, metrics view, export).
- **HTTP chaos/fault injection** — a general `HttpChaosProfile` (probabilistic error status + latency) attachable to any mocked **or forwarded** response, making MockServer usable as a chaos proxy for unreliable upstreams.
- **Platform modernisation (breaking)** — minimum runtime raised to **Java 17**; full **Jakarta EE 10 / Servlet 6** migration (Spring 7 / Boot 4, Tomcat 11, Jetty 12, Jersey 4, Netty 4.2); `json-schema-validator` 3.x; a bundled DataFaker template helper; and ZGC tuning guidance.

### Security

- **Released Docker images are now cosign-signed by digest** (Docker Hub and ECR Public), using the same signing key infrastructure as the Helm OCI chart. Consumers can verify image provenance with `cosign verify`. Signing is non-fatal in the pipeline if the key is unavailable, so it never blocks a release.
- **Website security hardening** — the documentation site (mock-server.com) now sends `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` response headers via CloudFront, and the domain publishes CAA records pinning certificate issuance to Amazon.
- **Build/release infrastructure hardening (internal)** — least-privilege scoping of CI secrets per Buildkite agent queue, removal of release-only permissions (ECR push) from the PR-build queue, secrets passed to release containers via `0600` files instead of `docker -e` environment variables, robust git-push-token cleanup, scoped cross-account `AssumeRole` (ExternalId) and tfstate IAM, full VPC flow logging, GuardDuty→SNS alerting, CloudTrail data-events on secrets/state, and SSE-KMS on the state and AWS Config buckets. See `docs/infrastructure/aws-infrastructure.md`, `docs/infrastructure/ci-cd.md`, and `docs/operations/website.md`.

### Added

- Added a **daily performance-regression pipeline** (notify-only) that guards response latency, throughput, and CPU/memory against drift across releases. It runs on a dedicated, pinned, on-demand, scale-to-zero Buildkite `perf` queue and fires once per day only when `master` moved since the last run. Each run measures four behaviours (mock match, forward/proxy, Velocity template, large-body) over HTTP and HTTPS/HTTP-2 (`k6/regression.js`), a sustained resource-growth run that surfaces "increases over time" regressions such as the issue #2329 O(n) log-eviction CPU climb (`k6/growth.js`, CPU/heap/latency slope ratios), and the JMH `MatchingBenchmark` allocation backstop. Results are persisted to S3 and each run is compared against a rolling median+MAD baseline of recent runs, posting a Buildkite annotation table when a metric regresses. See `docs/operations/performance-tuning.md`.

#### LLM & AI-agent mocking
- Added a dedicated **`retrieve_logs` MCP tool** so an AI assistant debugging a failing test can pull MockServer's recorded log messages (request matching, mismatches, actions and errors) directly. It is a thin, discoverable wrapper over the existing LOGS retrieval path (shared with `raw_retrieve`), with an optional `correlationId` filter (trace one request's full lifecycle) and a `limit` (most-recent N, default 100, max 500). This fills the gap left by its sibling tools `retrieve_recorded_requests` / `retrieve_request_responses`, which already existed. See the AI/MCP tools page.
- Added a **runtime-LLM client SPI** (`org.mockserver.llm.client`) that lets MockServer call a real LLM you already run, as the foundation for opt-in features such as drift detection and exploratory semantic matching. Mirrors the existing codec registry: an `LlmClient` per provider (Ollama, OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock) registered in `LlmClientRegistry`, an immutable `LlmBackend` config (with the API key redacted in logs), and a three-layer `LlmBackendResolver` (provider env vars → `mockserver.llmProvider`/`llmApiKey`/`llmModel`/`llmBaseUrl` → named-backends JSON via `mockserver.llmBackendsConfig`). All runtime-LLM use goes through `LlmCompletionService`, which is **off unless a backend is configured**, **fails closed** on any timeout/error/non-2xx (never flipping a deterministic result), and caches per normalised prompt for reproducibility. Ollama is the reference backend (no key, local); Bedrock builds the Anthropic-on-Bedrock request and relies on the `headers` escape hatch pending automatic SigV4 signing. See the configuration properties page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- LLM conversation mocks can now opt into deterministic **prompt normalisation** before the `latestMessageContains` / `latestMessageMatches` predicates are evaluated, so a match is not blocked by cosmetic differences in dynamically-assembled agent prompts. A new `normalization` block on `conversationPredicates` (also exposed per-turn in the `create_llm_conversation` MCP tool and the dashboard conversation wizard) supports collapsing whitespace, lowercasing, sorting JSON object keys, dropping built-in volatile values (ISO-8601 timestamps, UUIDs, `req_`/`msg_`/`call_` ids), and dropping named JSON fields. Normalisation is pure and idempotent — it never makes a test flaky — and has no effect unless a text predicate is set. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added two MCP tools for **agent-run analysis and tool-call assertions**, both backed by a new deterministic `org.mockserver.llm.analysis.AgentRunAnalyzer` that reconstructs an agent run by decoding the LLM requests MockServer recorded. `verify_tool_call` asserts that an agent called a named tool a given number of times (`atLeast`/`atMost`, with an optional regex over the tool-call arguments); `explain_agent_run` summarises the run's structure (message and assistant-turn counts, the ordered tool-call sequence, tool results, and the latest message role). Read-only and offline — no LLM call. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added a **correlated agent-run call graph**. `AgentRunAnalyzer.buildCallGraph` reconstructs a recorded run as a graph — a node per message and per assistant tool call, with `NEXT` (sequence), `INVOKES` (turn→tool call), and `RESULT` (tool call→its result, correlated by tool-call id) edges — exposed in the `explain_agent_run` MCP result as a `callGraph` field. The dashboard **Sessions** view renders it per session (a "Call graph" button loads it via `explain_agent_run`): each step shows the message role and the tool calls it made, with a result indicator, plus a copyable Mermaid `flowchart` source. Deterministic and read-only. See `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added opt-in, **exploratory semantic prompt matching** for LLM conversations: a `semanticMatch` turn predicate (the intent the latest message should express) judged by a runtime LLM via the client SPI. It is **off by default and never on the assertion path** — the predicate is ignored unless `mockserver.llmSemanticMatchingEnabled` is set *and* a runtime backend resolves, so deterministic matching is never affected by default. Non-deterministic by nature (a live LLM judge), so it is documented for exploration only, never for CI assertions; fails closed (a non-affirmative/empty/errored judge does not match). Exposed in the Java `TurnBuilder.whenSemanticMatch`, the `create_llm_conversation` MCP tool, and the dashboard wizard (clearly flagged exploratory). See `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.

#### LLM resilience, validation & cost testing
- Added a **`verify_structured_output` MCP tool**: validate that the structured (JSON) output of recorded LLM responses conforms to a JSON Schema. It decodes each recorded response for a given provider (via the runtime-LLM client SPI), extracts the assistant's output text, and checks it against the schema — so you can assert that an agent (or a mocked model) produced schema-valid structured output. Read-only and deterministic; responses with no text output are reported separately as skipped, and the result gives per-response conformance with validation errors. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- A mock LLM completion can now declare an **`outputSchema`** (a JSON Schema) that its response `text` is expected to conform to. As the response is encoded, MockServer validates the configured text against the schema and, on a mismatch, **fail-soft**: the response body is returned exactly as configured but an `x-mockserver-structured-output-invalid` diagnostic header is added and a warning logged — so a malformed structured-output fixture is surfaced immediately while a deliberately non-conforming fixture still returns unchanged. A blank schema, absent text, or a malformed schema are all treated as "nothing to check" and never affect the response. Exposed on the Java `Completion.withOutputSchema(...)`, the `outputSchema` field in expectation JSON, and the `mock_llm_completion` MCP tool (string or inline object). Complements the read-side `verify_structured_output` tool. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added a **`verify_cost_budget` MCP tool**: a deterministic, read-only cost gate for agent runs. It decodes each recorded LLM response for a provider (via the runtime-LLM client SPI), sums the input/output tokens from each response's usage, prices them with a new built-in pricing table (`org.mockserver.llm.cost.LlmPricing`, mirroring the dashboard's `llmPricing.ts` — same prefixes/rates), and asserts the total estimated USD cost is at or below `maxCostUsd`. The model can be pinned via a `model` param or read per-response from the recorded request body; responses with no usage are skipped and responses whose model has no known price are reported as `unpriceable` and excluded from the total. The result gives token/cost totals, `withinBudget`, and a per-response breakdown. Pricing is public list pricing captured 2025-Q4 (an estimate, not an invoice). See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added declarative **LLM fault/chaos profiles** for resilience testing, attachable to any mock LLM response (`mock_llm_completion`, each `create_llm_conversation` turn, the Java `LlmConversationBuilder`, and raw expectation JSON via a `chaos` block). Supports probabilistic provider errors (e.g. 429/529 with a `Retry-After` header), mid-stream truncation of an SSE stream (keep a leading fraction of events), and appending a malformed (broken-JSON) SSE chunk. Errors are deterministic at probability 0.0/1.0 and reproducible at fractional probabilities via a `seed`; truncation and malformed-SSE are always deterministic. A new `LLM_CHAOS_INJECTED_COUNT` metric tracks injections. The dashboard conversation wizard exposes the profile per turn. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added a **stateful request quota** to the LLM chaos profile — a deterministic fixed-window rate limit, the stateful counterpart to the existing probabilistic 429. Set `quotaName`, `quotaLimit`, and `quotaWindowMillis` (optional `quotaErrorStatus`, default 429) on a `chaos` block and requests beyond the limit within the window are rejected with that status and the `retryAfter` header. Expectations sharing a `quotaName` share one counter (model an upstream account limit across several mocks); the count resets when the window elapses and on server reset. Backed by a new process-wide, thread-safe `org.mockserver.llm.LlmQuotaRegistry` (injectable clock for deterministic tests). Exposed in expectation JSON, the `mock_llm_completion`/`create_llm_conversation` `chaos` MCP parameter, and the Java `LlmChaosProfile`. A misconfigured/partial quota fails open (never rate-limits). See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added a **prompt-injection / adversarial-response harness** for testing agent resilience. A new `mock_adversarial_llm_response` MCP tool returns a curated adversarial payload as the mock LLM response — prompt-injection ("ignore previous instructions…"), jailbreak persona-swaps, data-exfiltration requests, malformed/truncated JSON, an empty response, and an over-long repetition — so you can verify your agent *resists* hostile or malformed model/tool output. Backed by `AdversarialResponseLibrary` (deterministic; the payloads are benign test fixtures, not working exploits). A defensive testing aid. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Added **drift detection** for LLM fixtures (`detect_llm_drift` MCP tool): replays a recorded cassette's exchanges against the live provider (via the runtime-LLM client SPI) and reports **structural** drift — new/removed fields and type changes in the responses — not semantic differences, so benign wording changes never flag. Built on a reusable, pure `StructuralShapeDiff` and a `DriftDetector` that **fails closed** per exchange (a network error or non-2xx live response is reported as could-not-check, never as drift, never thrown). Off unless a runtime backend is configured. Intended for an opt-in/scheduled CI lane (real API keys + tokens), never the per-commit build. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.
- Completed the **VCR (record/replay) toolkit** for LLM fixtures with three additions. (1) **Strict mode** — `load_expectations_from_file` accepts `strict` (or set `mockserver.llmVcrStrict`), which registers a low-priority catch-all per cassette path so a request matching no recorded fixture returns HTTP 599 instead of silently falling through. (2) **Body-field redaction** — `record_llm_fixtures` accepts `redactBodyFields` (or set `mockserver.fixtureBodyRedactFields`) to redact named JSON fields from recorded request/response bodies, complementing the existing header redaction. (3) **Replay field normalisation** — `load_expectations_from_file` accepts `normalizeRequestBodyFields` to drop volatile JSON fields from each recorded request body and match the remainder loosely (ignoring extra fields), so per-run values (request ids, timestamps) do not block replay. These are operational settings exposed via config and MCP. See the AI/MCP tools and configuration properties pages.

#### HTTP chaos & protocol contract testing
- Added a **time-to-live (auto-revert) to service-scoped chaos** — an optional `ttlMillis` on a `PUT /mockserver/serviceChaos` registration makes the chaos automatically revert after that many milliseconds (a "dead-man's switch" so a fault self-heals even if the matching clear is never sent — e.g. an external chaos orchestrator crashes mid-experiment). It is also the one-shot time-box form: a single call breaks a host for a bounded window. Expiry is measured with the controllable clock (real-time by default, deterministic under `PUT /mockserver/clock`) and is applied lazily on the next lookup. Exposed via the endpoint, the Java/Node/Python/Ruby clients (`setServiceChaos(host, chaos, ttlMillis)` / `ttl_millis`), and the `manage_service_chaos` MCP tool. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#service_scoped_chaos) page.
- Added **service-scoped chaos** — register one `HttpChaosProfile` for an upstream host and have it applied to all matched forwards to that host, instead of attaching a `chaos` block to every forwarding expectation (the "break service X" control for running MockServer as a chaos proxy). Manage it through a new control-plane endpoint `PUT/GET /mockserver/serviceChaos` (`{"host":...,"chaos":{...}}` to register, `{"host":...,"remove":true}` to remove, `{"clear":true}` to clear all), protected by control-plane authentication. Resolution happens only on the matched-forward path keyed by the request `Host` header (case-insensitive, port-ignored); an expectation's own `chaos` always takes precedence, the anonymous proxy fall-through is unaffected, and registrations clear on server reset. Backed by a new process-wide `org.mockserver.mock.action.http.ServiceChaosRegistry`. Convenience wrappers are exposed in all four clients (`setServiceChaos`/`removeServiceChaos`/`clearServiceChaos`/`serviceChaosStatus` in Java/Node, the snake-case equivalents in Python/Ruby) and via the `manage_service_chaos` MCP tool. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#service_scoped_chaos) page.
- Added **gradual degradation** to the HTTP `chaos` block — a `degradationRampMillis` that linearly ramps `errorProbability` and `dropConnectionProbability` from 0 up to their configured values over the window from the expectation's first match, modelling a dependency that deteriorates over time (for alerting / SLO-burn tests). The ramp is measured with MockServer's controllable clock, so it is deterministic under clock freeze/advance with no real-time waiting; only the probabilistic rates ramp (latency, body corruption, slow response and quota are unaffected). Exposed in expectation JSON, the Java/Node/Python/Ruby clients, and the `create_expectation` `chaos` MCP parameter. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#gradual_degradation) page.
- Added a **stateful request quota** to the HTTP `chaos` block — a deterministic fixed-window rate limit, the HTTP counterpart of the existing probabilistic 429 and of the LLM quota. Set `quotaName`, `quotaLimit` and `quotaWindowMillis` (optional `quotaErrorStatus`, default 429) and requests beyond the limit within the window are rejected with that status and the `retryAfter` header. Expectations sharing a `quotaName` share one counter (model an upstream account limit across several mocks); the count resets when the window elapses and on server reset. The quota gate takes priority over the probabilistic error and the body/slow faults (after connection-drop). Backed by a new process-wide, thread-safe `org.mockserver.mock.action.http.HttpQuotaRegistry` (separate from the LLM quota registry). Exposed in expectation JSON, the Java/Node/Python/Ruby clients, and the `create_expectation` `chaos` MCP parameter; metered as `fault_type=quota`. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#request_quota) page.
- Added a **slow (dribbled) response** fault to `HttpChaosProfile` — `slowResponseChunkSize` + `slowResponseChunkDelay` trickle the response body to the client in small chunks with a delay between each (via chunked transfer-encoding), for testing read timeouts and slow-network handling (distinct from `latency`, which delays the whole response by a fixed amount). Both fields are required; deterministic; applies to the real mocked or forwarded response within the active count and outage windows; skipped for streaming bodies; metered as `fault_type=slow`. Exposed in expectation JSON, the Java/Node/Python/Ruby clients, and the `create_expectation` `chaos` MCP parameter. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#slow_response) page.
- Added **response-body corruption** faults to `HttpChaosProfile` — `truncateBodyAtFraction` keeps only a leading fraction of the body bytes (e.g. `0.5` returns the first half, `0.0` empties it) and `malformedBody` appends a broken-JSON fragment so the payload fails to parse, for testing client-side body-parsing and partial-response resilience. Both are deterministic (no probability draw), apply to the real mocked or forwarded response within the active count and outage windows, preserve the `Content-Type` and drop any stale `Content-Length` (the encoder then sets the correct length) so the response stays well-framed, and are skipped for streaming bodies. Connection-drop and error injection still take priority (an injected error body is never corrupted). Exposed in expectation JSON, the Java/Node/Python/Ruby clients, and the `create_expectation` `chaos` MCP parameter; metered as `fault_type=truncate` / `fault_type=malformed`. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#body_corruption) page.
- Added **time-based outage windows** (`outageAfterMillis` / `outageDurationMillis`) to `HttpChaosProfile` — chaos becomes active a configurable time after the expectation's first match and (optionally) self-heals after a bounded duration, modelling a dependency that degrades for a transient window then recovers. The window is measured with MockServer's controllable clock, so it is deterministic under clock freeze/advance (`PUT /mockserver/clock`) with no real-time waiting; it composes with the count window and the probability fields.
- Added **connection-drop chaos fault** (`dropConnectionProbability`) to `HttpChaosProfile` — probabilistic TCP connection drops (no response sent) on both mocked and forwarded responses, simulating hard network failures. Drop faults take priority over error and latency injection (drop > error > latency). Uses a derived seed for independent but reproducible draws alongside `errorProbability`.
- Added declarative **HTTP chaos/fault injection** (`HttpChaosProfile`) for resilience testing, attachable to any expectation via a top-level `chaos` block. Supports probabilistic error-status injection (e.g. 500, 503, 429 with an optional `Retry-After` header) and latency injection. Works on **both mocked responses** (RESPONSE, RESPONSE_TEMPLATE, RESPONSE_CLASS_CALLBACK) **and forwarded/proxied responses** (FORWARD, FORWARD_TEMPLATE, FORWARD_CLASS_CALLBACK, FORWARD_REPLACE, FORWARD_VALIDATE), making MockServer usable as a chaos proxy for testing how applications handle unreliable upstream dependencies. Deterministic at `errorProbability` 0.0/1.0; reproducible at fractional probabilities via a `seed`. Exposed in the Java client (`ForwardChainExpectation.withChaos()`), REST API, and expectation JSON. See the new [Chaos Testing & Fault Injection](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html) documentation page.
- Added **count-based stateful faults** to the HTTP `chaos` block — a `succeedFirst` / `failRequestCount` request-count window so an expectation can succeed the first N matches, then fault the next M, then recover. Expresses fail-first-N-then-recover (retry/backoff testing), succeed-N-then-fail, and fail-only-the-Nth, on both mocked and forwarded responses; deterministic by match index, composes with `errorProbability`, and is backward compatible (no window fields = unchanged). See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#stateful_count_based_faults) page.
- Added a **Driving MockServer from Chaos Orchestrators** guide showing how external chaos-engineering tools drive MockServer's service-scoped chaos through the control-plane endpoint — concrete inject/verify/revert recipes for Chaos Toolkit, AWS FIS (SSM RunShellScript), Azure Chaos Studio (Automation runbook / pipeline), LitmusChaos (BYOC cmdProbe/httpProbe), and any cron/CI/Step Functions scheduler — all using the `ttlMillis` dead-man's switch so a fault auto-reverts even if the orchestrator never sends the clear. See the [Chaos Orchestrators](/mock_server/chaos_testing_orchestrators.html) page.
- Added a **Chaos Proxy in Kubernetes** guide showing how to deploy MockServer as a chaos proxy in Kubernetes to inject faults into real service-to-service and external API calls — reverse-proxy, egress/forward-proxy, and sidecar deployment patterns with concrete Kubernetes manifests and expectation JSON examples. See the [Chaos Proxy in Kubernetes](/mock_server/chaos_testing_kubernetes.html) page.
- Added a **chaos-proxy example to the Helm chart** — a commented reverse-proxy + chaos `initializerJson` block in `values.yaml` and a "Chaos Proxy (fault injection)" section in the chart README, showing how to deploy MockServer in front of an upstream Service and inject faults through the chart's inline configuration. Links to the Chaos Testing and Chaos Proxy in Kubernetes guides.
- Added an **MCP server conformance tester** (`run_mcp_contract_test` MCP tool): point it at a target MCP (Model Context Protocol) server's Streamable HTTP endpoint and it runs the required JSON-RPC handshake and core methods — `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `ping`, `tools/list`, and unknown-method rejection (expects error code `-32601`) — validating the **shape** of each response (JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope and required result fields), never the semantics of any tool. Optionally exercises one `tools/call` (skipped by default, since a call may have side effects on the target). Fully deterministic and offline-from-LLMs (no model is involved); each request has a 10-second timeout. Backed by a network-free, unit-testable `McpContractTest` orchestrator with an injected transport. See the AI/MCP tools page and `docs/code/llm-mocking.md`.

#### Observability & dashboard
- Added an **active service-scoped chaos gauge** — a Prometheus `mock_server_active_service_chaos` gauge (when `metricsEnabled`) labeled by `fault_type` (`drop`/`error`/`latency`/`truncate`/`malformed`/`slow`/`quota`), reporting per fault type how many currently-active service-scoped chaos profiles are configured with that fault (a profile with several faults counts under each). It is a callback gauge that reads `ServiceChaosRegistry` at scrape time, so each series drops to 0 as profiles are cleared or their TTLs lapse (making `sum(mock_server_active_service_chaos) > 0` a natural "chaos still live" alert and letting you alert on a specific fault type), and it is mirrored over OTLP alongside the chaos-fault-injection counter. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html) page.
- The dashboard **Metrics view "HTTP Chaos Faults" section now shows every fault type** the server emits (`drop`, `error`, `latency`, `truncate`, `malformed`, `slow`, `quota`) — previously only `error` and `latency` — with a per-fault-type chart of cumulative injections and a separate per-fault-type chart of the active service-scoped chaos gauge (plotted by type rather than as a single counter). Fault types are discovered from the scrape, so a future type renders automatically without a UI change. See `docs/code/dashboard-ui.md`.
- Added a **Chaos tab to the dashboard UI** for managing service-scoped chaos interactively (`ServiceChaosPanel`): register a host with an error status / error probability / drop probability / latency (and an optional TTL), see every active registration with a summary of its faults, watch the live TTL auto-revert countdown, and remove a single host or clear them all. It polls `GET /mockserver/serviceChaos` and drives the same control-plane endpoint as the clients and the `manage_service_chaos` MCP tool. The `/mockserver/serviceChaos` responses now carry CORS headers unconditionally (matching the metrics and MCP endpoints), so the dashboard works when served from a different origin (e.g. the UI dev server) without needing `enableCORSForAPI`. See the [Chaos Testing](/mock_server/chaos_testing.html#service_scoped_chaos) page and `docs/code/dashboard-ui.md`.
- Added optional **OpenTelemetry (OTLP) export**, in two independent, off-by-default parts. (1) **Metrics export** — MockServer's existing metrics (the same explicitly-defined gauges already exposed for Prometheus: `REQUESTS_RECEIVED_COUNT`, `RESPONSE_EXPECTATIONS_MATCHED_COUNT`, the LLM/SSE/chaos counters, etc.) can also be pushed to an OTLP collector as an alternative to Prometheus (`mockserver.otelMetricsEnabled`). Implemented as OTel observable gauges reading the current values, so the Prometheus and OTLP views stay in lock-step. (2) **GenAI span export** — MockServer emits one explicit OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic-convention span per LLM completion it serves (`gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`/`output_tokens`, `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons`, tool-call count) (`mockserver.otelTracesEnabled`). These are spans MockServer codes deliberately — **no auto-instrumentation** is added. Both use the OTLP HTTP/protobuf exporter with the JDK HttpClient sender (no gRPC/OkHttp), share `mockserver.otelEndpoint`, and are fail-soft (a setup error logs one line and never stops the server or affects a response). `io.opentelemetry.*` is relocated in the shaded JAR. See the configuration properties page.
- Added **JVM runtime metrics** to MockServer's Prometheus endpoint (`GET /mockserver/metrics`, when `metricsEnabled`): heap and non-heap memory (used / committed / max, labelled by `area`), live and daemon thread counts, and total GC collection count and time. Exposed via a dependency-free collector that reads JDK MX beans, so Grafana and the dashboard Metrics view can chart process health alongside the existing request/action counters.
- Added a **request-latency histogram** to MockServer's Prometheus endpoint (`mock_server_request_duration_seconds`, when `metricsEnabled`): classic histogram buckets from 0.5 ms to 10 s, recorded per request from receipt to response. Enables latency percentiles (p50 / p95 / p99 via `histogram_quantile`) in Grafana and the dashboard. Recording is fully gated behind `metricsEnabled`, so it adds nothing to the request path when metrics are off.
- Added a **Metrics view** to the dashboard UI: a new top-bar tab that polls MockServer's Prometheus endpoint (`GET /mockserver/metrics`) and renders live activity — request / matched / not-matched / forwarded counts with inline sparklines, a derived requests-per-second throughput chart, a per-action breakdown, **JVM heap / thread / GC panels**, and **request-latency percentiles (p50 / p95 / p99)** — the JVM and latency panels appear only when the server exposes those metrics — plus the served MockServer version. Time-series charts use `@mui/x-charts`, lazy-loaded so they add nothing to the initial dashboard load. It degrades gracefully: when MockServer is started without `metricsEnabled` the endpoint returns 404 and the view shows guidance to enable it (`-Dmockserver.metricsEnabled=true` / `MOCKSERVER_METRICS_ENABLED=true`). See `docs/code/dashboard-ui.md`.
- Recorded requests can now be exported as **cURL commands**. A new `CURL` value for the `/mockserver/retrieve` `format` parameter (valid for `type=REQUESTS` and `type=REQUEST_RESPONSES`) renders one `curl` command per recorded request via the existing `HttpRequestToCurlSerializer`; the expectation scopes return a clear "not supported" message. Surfaced in the dashboard Export page. See the configuration/retrieve docs.

#### Templating & runtime
- Added a **clock-control endpoint** (`PUT /mockserver/clock`, `GET /mockserver/clock`) for deterministic time-based testing. Freeze the server clock at a specific ISO-8601 instant, advance it by a duration in milliseconds, or reset it to real wall-clock time. The controllable clock affects response template date/time helpers (`now_iso_8601`, `now_epoch`, `now_rfc_1123`, and the `dates` helper object) and **expectation TimeToLive expiry**, so frozen time prevents expectations from expiring mid-test. Protected by control-plane authentication (JWT/mTLS) when configured. Limitation: event-log timestamps and JWT token issuance use a separate time source and are not affected. See the [Clearing, Resetting & Clock Control](/mock_server/clearing_and_resetting.html#clock_control) page.
- DataFaker (`net.datafaker:datafaker:2.5.4`) is now bundled as a template helper. A single shared `Faker` instance is exposed as `faker` in all three response-template engines (Velocity, Mustache, JavaScript) via `TemplateFunctions.BUILT_IN_HELPERS`, giving templates access to 250+ realistic-fake-data providers (`faker.name().firstName()`, `faker.internet().emailAddress()`, `faker.address().city()`, etc.). The instance is thread-safe and produces fresh random values on each call. See the consumer docs (response templates page) for the full provider list and per-engine syntax. Java 17 unlocked this — DataFaker 2.x requires Java 17; the previous Java 11 floor pinned us to the abandoned 1.9.0 line.
- Documented ZGC (`-XX:+UseZGC`) as a recommended GC for deployments with large heaps (≥ 4 GB) or deep `maxLogEntries` ring buffers. Java 17 ships production-ready ZGC; for matcher-path latency this can reduce p99 pauses from tens or hundreds of milliseconds (G1 under sustained allocation) into single-digit milliseconds. ZGC is not the default because typical MockServer fixtures run small heaps where Parallel/G1 are fine and ZGC's fixed memory overhead hurts sub-2 GB scenarios. Includes container-memory headroom guidance (size container limit at ~1.5× heap when using ZGC). See the performance tuning page on the website.

#### HTTP/3, transparent proxy & infrastructure

- **HTTP/3 streaming / SSE responses** (`Http3ResponseWriter`): `StreamingBody` responses (Server-Sent Events, chunked proxy forwarding, LLM streaming) are now fully supported over HTTP/3. `Http3ResponseWriter` subscribes to the `StreamingBody`, sends HTTP/3 headers immediately, and forwards each chunk as an HTTP/3 DATA frame with backpressure via `StreamingBody.requestMore()`. The QUIC stream output is shut down on completion or error. Resolves the previous limitation where only static response bodies could be returned over HTTP/3. See `docs/code/http3.md`.
- **gRPC streaming over HTTP/3 — server-streaming and bidi-streaming** (completes the gRPC-over-HTTP/3 work). A `grpcStreamResponse` expectation now streams each message as its own HTTP/3 DATA frame (with per-message delays) followed by a trailing `grpc-status` HEADERS frame; `HttpActionHandler` routes the `GRPC_STREAM_RESPONSE` action to the new transport-neutral `GrpcStreamResponseWriter` seam (implemented by `Http3GrpcResponseWriter`) for HTTP/3, while HTTP/2 is unchanged. A `grpcBidiResponse` expectation now drives true bidirectional streaming over a single full-duplex QUIC stream via the new `Http3GrpcBidiStreamHandler` (gated by the existing `grpcBidiStreamingEnabled` flag, same two-phase peek-then-consume matching and `responseInProgress` lifecycle as the HTTP/2 path). Message encoding and rule matching are shared across transports via new `GrpcStreamMessageEncoder` / `GrpcBidiRuleMatcher` core helpers. Covered by native-QUIC integration tests (`Http3GrpcStreamingIntegrationTest`). With this, gRPC over HTTP/3 reaches full parity with HTTP/2 (unary, server-streaming, bidi-streaming). See `docs/code/http3.md`.
- **Bundled native QUIC** — the `netty-incubator-codec-http3` dependency pulls in `netty-incubator-codec-native-quic` classifiers for all five supported platforms (`linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch_64`, `osx-x86_64`, `osx-aarch_64`, `windows-x86_64`) automatically; no separately downloaded BoringSSL library is required. An in-JVM Netty QUIC-client integration test verifies the full pipeline parity including streaming, gated on `Quic.isAvailable()` so the suite degrades gracefully where native QUIC is absent.
- **TPROXY (`IP_TRANSPARENT`) transparent-proxy strategy** — a new default-off `transparentProxyTproxy` configuration property (`-Dmockserver.transparentProxyTproxy=true` / `MOCKSERVER_TRANSPARENT_PROXY_TPROXY=true`) enables `IP_TRANSPARENT` socket binding so that, with iptables TPROXY rules, the kernel preserves the original destination as the listening socket's local address — which MockServer reads directly via `channel.localAddress()`, as an alternative to the existing conntrack `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` strategy (REDIRECT rules). Requires Linux, the `epoll` transport (NIO unsupported), and `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. The transparent proxy `enabled` flag (`transparentProxyEnabled`) is unchanged; the new property selects the kernel mechanism only. Verified end-to-end with a real Docker `NET_ADMIN` integration test for both `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` and TPROXY paths. eBPF sockmap-based redirection is deferred (placeholder added). See `docs/infrastructure/service-mesh.md`.
- **Testcontainers 1.21.4** — upgraded from 1.20.6, picking up docker-java 3.4.2 which fixes `DockerClientFactory.isDockerAvailable()` returning `false` on Docker Desktop 4.67 / Engine API 1.54 (the 3.4.1 `/info` probe sent the wrong Content-Type header and received HTTP 400, causing a false-negative result). No API or behaviour change for callers; tests that previously skipped on Docker Desktop 4.67+ now run correctly.

#### Clustered state (opt-in, `mockserver-state-infinispan`)

- Added a **`StateBackend` SPI** in `mockserver-core` (`org.mockserver.state.StateBackend`) — a pluggable interface that abstracts all shared MockServer state into three store types: a versioned `KeyValueStore<ExpectationEntry>` (expectations), a `KeyValueStore<String>` (scenario states), `KeyValueStore<ObjectNode>` (CRUD entities per namespace), and a `BlobStore` (persisted cassettes and fixtures). `InvalidationListener` callbacks allow clustered implementations to trigger node-local rebuilds when a remote write arrives. The default implementation is `InMemoryStateBackend`, which wraps the existing concurrent data structures — single-node behaviour and performance are completely unchanged.
- Added `mockserver-state-infinispan`, a new optional Maven module providing an embedded Infinispan `StateBackend` that can replicate MockServer expectations and scenario state across a JGroups cluster. Classpath-auto-discovered when `mockserver.stateBackend=infinispan` is configured (via `StateBackendFactory` reflection — `mockserver-core` has no compile-time dependency on Infinispan). Two modes: **LOCAL** (single-node, no JGroups, heap-only Infinispan cache, permissive serialization allow-list) and **CLUSTERED** (`clusterEnabled=true`, REPL_SYNC caches, JGroups transport, explicit serialization allow-list covering exactly the MockServer domain types). Expectations and scenario states use `REPL_SYNC` so all writes are synchronously replicated to every cluster member. An Infinispan `@Listener(clustered=true)` fires `InvalidationListener.onChanged()` on remote writes, triggering `RequestMatchers.reconcileFromBackend()` on the receiving node to rebuild its local `HttpRequestMatcher` cache. Approximate eviction (`maxCount`) on the expectations cache matches the `maxExpectations` configuration property. See `docs/code/clustered-state.md`.
- New configuration properties for state clustering:

  | Property | Env var | Default | Description |
  |----------|---------|---------|-------------|
  | `mockserver.stateBackend` | `MOCKSERVER_STATE_BACKEND` | `memory` | Backend type: `memory` or `infinispan` |
  | `mockserver.blobStoreType` | `MOCKSERVER_BLOB_STORE_TYPE` | `filesystem` | Blob store type: `filesystem` or `memory` |
  | `mockserver.clusterEnabled` | `MOCKSERVER_CLUSTER_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable JGroups cluster transport |
  | `mockserver.clusterName` | `MOCKSERVER_CLUSTER_NAME` | `mockserver-cluster` | JGroups cluster identifier |
  | `mockserver.clusterTransportConfig` | `MOCKSERVER_CLUSTER_TRANSPORT_CONFIG` | _(built-in loopback)_ | Path to a custom JGroups XML transport config |

  Setting `stateBackend=infinispan` without `clusterEnabled=true` starts Infinispan in LOCAL mode (single-node, functionally equivalent to the default in-memory backend but adds Infinispan on the classpath). A misconfigured `stateBackend=infinispan` where the module is absent fails fast with `IllegalStateException` rather than silently falling through to in-memory (which would cause split-brain). Scenario-state transitions are atomic cluster-wide (versioned compare-and-set), and shared `Times` counters (per-expectation match limits) are enforced cluster-wide via backend CAS (exactly-once across nodes). Remaining node-local aspects: the request/event log and `verify()` are per-node (verification queries a single node's log). See `docs/code/clustered-state.md`.

### Changed
- Upgraded the Prometheus metrics client (`io.prometheus:prometheus-metrics-core`, `-exposition-formats`, `-model`) from `1.6.1` to `1.7.0`. Source- and behaviour-compatible (metrics are emitted only when `metricsEnabled`); the metrics exposition format is unchanged. `io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` is deliberately **not** bumped alongside it — tcnative is version-locked to Netty (its per-platform classifier artifacts arrive transitively at Netty's tcnative version, so an independent bump breaks Maven `dependencyConvergence`); it is now in the Dependabot ignore list and is upgraded manually in lockstep with the `netty.version` bump.
- `LlmChaosProfile` now validates its numeric fields in its `withX` builder methods, matching the validation `HttpChaosProfile` already enforces: `errorProbability` / `truncateAtFraction` must be in `[0.0, 1.0]`, `errorStatus` / `quotaErrorStatus` in `[100, 599]`, and `quotaLimit` / `quotaWindowMillis` ≥ 1. An out-of-range value now throws `IllegalArgumentException` with a clear message when a profile is built via the Java client or parsed from the `chaos` MCP parameter, instead of being silently accepted.
- Reworked the dashboard **Export** page: choose the scope (Active expectations / Recorded requests) with a radio and the file format with a dropdown, instead of one long combined list. Added **JAVA** (expectations), **log-entries** (requests) and **cURL** (requests) formats, filtered by the chosen scope, and the best-effort caveat is now shown only when it applies. Export is now the first Library tab. The **run comparison** tool moved out of Library into a new **Compare** tab under **Sessions** (where it belongs, since it diffs sessions).
- Upgraded the **chicory** WASM interpreter (`com.dylibso.chicory:runtime`) from `0.0.12` to `1.7.5`, moving off the old pre-1.0 release onto the stable 1.x line. `WasmRuntime` is migrated to the new API (`Parser.parse(bytes)` → `WasmModule`, `Instance.builder(module).build()`, and `ExportFunction.apply(long…)` returning `long[]`). The experimental WASM custom-rule feature's behaviour and module ABI (`match(i32 ptr, i32 len) -> i32`) are unchanged.
- Upgraded `com.networknt:json-schema-validator` from 1.5.9 to 3.0.3. The 3.x line uses the `tools.jackson` (Jackson 3.x) namespace internally and `snakeyaml-engine` for YAML schemas. MockServer's external Jackson usage stays on 2.22.0; the two Jackson namespaces coexist because they are in different Java packages. `JsonSchemaValidator` is rewritten against the new `Schema` / `SchemaRegistry` / `SpecificationVersion` API and uses the string-based `getSchema(String, InputFormat.JSON)` and `validate(String, InputFormat.JSON)` entry points to avoid passing Jackson 2.x `JsonNode` objects into Jackson 3.x APIs. `PathType.JSON_PATH` is configured so validation messages keep the existing `$.property` format and no test fixture had to change. The shaded uber-JAR adds two new relocations (`tools.jackson` and `org.snakeyaml`).
- BREAKING: minimum supported Java runtime raised from **Java 11** to **Java 17**. `mockserver/pom.xml` `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target` are now `17`, so published artifacts are Java 17 bytecode and will not run on a Java 11 JVM. The CodeQL workflow, Buildkite build agent image, and local dev scripts have all been aligned to JDK 17.
- BREAKING: coordinated upgrade to the Jakarta EE 10 / Servlet 6 stack and the upstream dependencies that required it. The full `javax.*` → `jakarta.*` namespace migration (servlet, ws.rs, annotation, inject, persistence) is now complete. Library bumps: Spring Framework 5.3 → 7.0, Spring Boot 2.7 → 4.0, Tomcat embed 9 → 11, Jetty 9.4 → 12, Jersey 3.1 → 4 (`jersey-apache-connector` → `jersey-apache5-connector` with Apache HttpClient 5), `jakarta.xml.bind-api` 3 → 4, `jakarta.servlet-api` 4 → 6, `jakarta.ws.rs-api` 2.1 → 4, `jakarta.annotation-api` 1.3 → 3, JUnit Jupiter 5.14 → 6.1, json-unit 2 → 5, json-path 2 → 3, Netty 4.1 → 4.2.15.Final (introduced via `netty-bom` so the new `netty-codec-base` / `netty-codec-compression` / `netty-codec-http3` sub-modules stay aligned).
  - Runtime deployment in a servlet container now requires a Servlet 6 / Jakarta EE 10 host: Tomcat 11+, Jetty 12+, WildFly 32+, or equivalent. Servlet 5 / Jakarta EE 9 containers are no longer supported.
  - `MockServerServlet` and `ProxyServlet` runtime contract is unchanged for consumers using `jakarta.servlet.*`. Consumers still importing `javax.servlet.*` must update their imports.
  - WAR test scaffolding that configured TLS via the removed `Connector.setAttribute("keystoreFile"/"keystorePass"/…)` API must migrate to the Tomcat 11 `SSLHostConfig` + `SSLHostConfigCertificate` pattern. The four WAR/proxy-war integration test classes in this repo show the working shape.
  - Servlet 6 preserves RFC 6265 surrounding double quotes on cookie values returned by `Cookie.getValue()`. MockServer's request decoder now strips them so cookie semantics are unchanged for clients.
  - Spring 7 requires the `-parameters` javac flag for `@PathVariable` / `@RequestParam` name resolution; this is now enabled project-wide in `maven-compiler-plugin`.
  - Spring 7's `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` is deprecated for removal in favour of `JacksonJsonHttpMessageConverter`. MockServer keeps Jackson at 2.22.0 for now because `swagger-parser` is still locked to Jackson 2; Jackson 3 upgrade will land once `swagger-parser` ships a Jackson 3 line (see #1970).
- BREAKING: Nashorn (`org.openjdk.nashorn:nashorn-core:15.7`) removed as a managed dependency. `JavaScriptTemplateEngine` now uses the GraalVM Polyglot API directly (`org.graalvm.polyglot.Context` with `HostAccess.ALL` + `allowHostClassLookup` for the existing class-deny-list security policy). GraalJS 25.x dropped the JSR-223 `javax.script` bridge, so the previous Nashorn-or-GraalJS-via-JSR-223 fallback would have silently returned a null engine and broken every JavaScript template at runtime. Downstream consumers that previously relied on Nashorn arriving transitively must add `org.openjdk.nashorn:nashorn-core` to their own dependencies, or migrate to GraalVM polyglot directly.
- Drop the `--add-exports=java.base/sun.security.{x509,util}=ALL-UNNAMED` javac flags inherited from the Java 11 era. Repo-wide audit found zero `sun.security.*` references after the Java 17 / jakarta migration, so the flags were dead weight.
- Performance: the request-matching hot path no longer builds the human-readable "did not match because…" diagnostic string (the per-field message assembly and per-field hint generation) when it would only be discarded — i.e. when the log level is below `INFO`. The match evaluation, the match-difference data behind `detailedMatchFailures` / debugMismatch / explainUnmatched / verification, and the match result are unchanged; only the discarded narrative is skipped, and the per-matcher `StringBuilder` is no longer allocated in that case. For a server with many registered expectations running below `INFO` under sustained load this measurably cuts per-request allocation and GC pressure (JMH `-prof gc`: ~36% less matching-path allocation at 1000 expectations and log level `WARN`; no change at the default `INFO`). See the performance documentation's note on `logLevel` and matching throughput. A new on-demand `mockserver-benchmark` JMH module (excluded from the default build) backs these numbers.

### Fixed
- **CPU no longer climbs as the request/event log fills (issue #2329).** `CircularConcurrentLinkedDeque` — the bounded ring used for the request/event log — checked capacity on every insert with `ConcurrentLinkedDeque.size()`, which is **O(n)** (it walks the whole list). Once the log reached `maxLogEntries` (default 100,000) each request paid an O(n) traversal per log entry, so CPU rose as the log filled and stayed high (and clearing *expectations* does not clear the *log*, so it never recovered). Size is now tracked in an `AtomicInteger`, making the eviction check and `size()` **O(1)**. Measured per-insert cost at the default capacity dropped from ~210µs to ~15ns (~14,000× at 100k entries; the old cost scaled linearly with `maxLogEntries`). No behaviour change — same bounded FIFO semantics and eviction callback. Tip for high-throughput users: also clear the log (`PUT /mockserver/clear?type=LOG` or `?type=ALL`, or `PUT /mockserver/reset`), not just expectations, or lower `maxLogEntries`.
- **Regex matching in the GraphQL, JSON-RPC and LLM-conversation matchers is now ReDoS-bounded.** User-supplied regular expressions for a GraphQL `operationName`, a JSON-RPC `method`, and an LLM conversation's `latestMessageMatches` are now evaluated under the shared `mockserver.regexMatchingTimeoutMillis` timeout via `MatchingTimeoutExecutor` — the same protection `RegexStringMatcher` already applies to path/header/body regexes — so a pathological pattern can no longer pin a worker thread (ReDoS). A timed-out evaluation is treated as a non-match. (Resolves CodeQL alert for `GraphQLMatcher`; the same fix is applied to the two sibling matchers.)
- Dashboard **Log Messages** panel: a non-breaking space is now rendered after each expandable JSON block, so the text that follows (e.g. `} matched expectation:`) no longer butts directly against the closing brace.
- **CORS for the dashboard served cross-origin.** When `mockserver.corsAllowOrigin` is blank (the default) MockServer now reflects the request's `Origin` in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` instead of emitting an empty (invalid) header, and falls back to sensible `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` / `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` when those are blank (reflecting the requested headers on preflight). The MCP endpoint (`/mockserver/mcp`) now answers the CORS preflight and exposes `Mcp-Session-Id` via `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. Together these let the dashboard (and any browser client) call the control-plane API and MCP endpoint from a different port or domain. An explicit `corsAllowOrigin` is still honoured as an allow-list, and `*` is never combined with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
- **CORS for the metrics endpoint (`/mockserver/metrics`).** The endpoint now adds the same `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers as the rest of the API, so the dashboard's Metrics view can fetch metrics when served cross-origin (e.g. the UI dev server on a different port). The disabled-state `404` carries the headers too, so the UI reads it cleanly and shows its "metrics disabled" guidance instead of a browser CORS fetch error.
- Helm chart downloads for older versions: every chart listed in `index.yaml` now returns a valid `.tgz` from `https://www.mock-server.com/`. Previously, releases that created a new versioned site could leave older chart archives missing from the live bucket while `index.yaml` still referenced them, so `helm pull` / `helm install` failed for any version other than the latest. The release pipeline now syncs the full set of charts on every run, making the bucket self-healing (fixes #2282).
- **`Content-Encoding` no longer leaks across requests on a reused (pooled) connection.** When a compressed request (e.g. `Content-Encoding: gzip`) was followed by an uncompressed request on the same keep-alive connection, the second request was incorrectly recorded with the first request's `Content-Encoding` header. The preserved-headers state is now reset per request, so each recorded request carries only its own encoding headers (fixes #2322).
- **Compressed request bodies now retain their original on-the-wire bytes.** When an HTTP/1.1 request arrives with a `Content-Encoding` (e.g. gzip), MockServer still decompresses it for matching/recording as before, but now also keeps the original compressed bytes alongside the decompressed body. A new `HttpRequest#getBodyAsOriginalRawBytes()` returns the exact bytes the client sent (the compressed payload when compressed, otherwise the decompressed bytes), so you can verify a client actually compressed its body; `getBodyAsRawBytes()` is unchanged (decompressed). A `BinaryBody` expectation now matches against **either** the decompressed body or the original compressed bytes, so a mixture of compressed and uncompressed requests matches automatically with no configuration. The original bytes are serialised (as `originalBody`) so they survive `retrieveRecordedRequests` and persistence (fixes #2326).
- **WASM custom-rule security controls are now enforced.** The `wasmEnabled` (default `false`) and `wasmMaxMemoryPages` (default `256`) configuration properties were documented as gating the experimental WASM custom-rule feature but were never actually read. WASM support is now disabled by default and fails closed: the WASM module control-plane endpoints (`PUT`/`GET`/`DELETE /mockserver/wasm/modules`) return `403` and `WasmBodyMatcher` does not match unless `mockserver.wasmEnabled=true`, and a loaded module's linear memory is now capped at `wasmMaxMemoryPages` via chicory `MemoryLimits` at instance creation. Set `wasmEnabled=true` to opt in.

### Removed
- Removed the **xDS route discovery** feature (REST endpoint `GET /mockserver/xds/routes`, gRPC RDS server, `xdsEnabled`/`xdsPort` configuration properties, and Helm `sidecar.xdsEnabled`/`sidecar.xdsPort` values). The feature shipped behind default-off flags and saw no adoption; real service mesh integration routes traffic to MockServer via an Istio VirtualService rather than having MockServer act as an RDS server. The **transparent proxy / sidecar mode** (`transparentProxyEnabled`, conntrack `SO_ORIGINAL_DST`, iptables init container) is fully retained.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-05-27

### Security
- SSRF protection for forward and forward-template actions: new `mockserver.forwardProxyBlockPrivateNetworks` property (default `false` for backwards compatibility) rejects forward targets that resolve to loopback, link-local, RFC 1918 private, or cloud metadata addresses (e.g. `169.254.169.254`). Enable in hardened or multi-tenant deployments where untrusted callers can register expectations. A future major release is expected to flip the default to `true`.
- ReDoS protection in regex matchers: regex evaluation now runs on a shared cached daemon-thread pool with a configurable timeout `mockserver.regexMatchingTimeoutMillis` (default `5000`ms). Patterns that exceed the budget are treated as non-matches and a WARN log entry is written, so a pathological pattern cannot wedge a Netty worker.
- XPath DoS protection: XPath evaluation in body matching now uses the same shared timeout executor with `mockserver.xpathMatchingTimeoutMillis` (default `5000`ms).
- Cryptographically secure randomness: `UUIDService` and `TemplateFunctions` now use `SecureRandom` instead of `java.util.Random` for UUID generation, `rand_int`/`rand_int_10`/`rand_int_100`, and `rand_bytes` template helpers.
- Loud insecure-mode warning logs at startup / SSL-context init: a WARN is emitted when (a) the forward proxy trusts all TLS certificates (`forwardProxyTLSX509CertificatesTrustManagerType=ANY`), (b) Velocity class loading is enabled (`velocityDisallowClassLoading=false`), (c) JavaScript templates have no class restrictions (`javascriptDisallowedClasses` empty), or (d) `tlsProtocols` includes the deprecated TLSv1 / TLSv1.1.
- `mockserver.tlsAllowInsecureProtocols` configuration property (default `true` for backwards compatibility): when set to `false`, any `TLSv1` or `TLSv1.1` entries in `mockserver.tlsProtocols` are filtered out before the SSL context is built, giving users an opt-in hardened TLS profile without having to rewrite their existing `tlsProtocols` value. A future major release is expected to flip this default to `false`.
- Secrets are no longer logged in plaintext: the startup property dump now redacts the values of properties whose name indicates a secret (password, secret, access key, API key, connection string, token, private key, credential, passphrase) as `***REDACTED***`. This covers the cloud blob credentials (`blobStoreSecretAccessKey`, `blobStoreConnectionString`), `llmApiKey`, `proxyAuthenticationPassword`, and similar, so they are not leaked to log aggregation.
- Kubernetes admission-webhook Helm hardening: fixed a shell-injection vector where the `webhook.tls.certValidityDays` value was interpolated unquoted into the self-signed-cert bootstrap Job (now quoted and integer-coerced); narrowed the TLS-bootstrap RBAC from cluster-wide Secret access to a namespace-scoped `Role` plus a `resourceNames`-restricted `ClusterRole` for the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` caBundle patch only; and removed the running webhook's unused Kubernetes API RBAC (the webhook is a pure HTTPS server) in favour of `automountServiceAccountToken: false`.
- HTTP/3 CONNECT-UDP (MASQUE) open-relay risk documented: when `http3ConnectUdpEnabled=true` the relay forwards to any target the client names (SSRF-equivalent); it is default-off and now clearly flagged as test-only in the configuration and HTTP/3 documentation.

### Fixed
- HTTP/3 request bodies are now capped at `maxRequestBodySize` (default 10 MiB), matching the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 paths; an over-cap HTTP/3 request is rejected (413 / QUIC stream shutdown) instead of being accumulated unboundedly in memory.
- Cloud BlobStore backends: cloud SDK clients (S3/GCS) are now closed on server shutdown (the `BlobStore` SPI is `AutoCloseable`, closed via the state backend) instead of leaking connection pools and threads; the Azure backend now encodes metadata keys reversibly so keys such as `x-custom-type` round-trip exactly and no longer collide with `x_custom_type` (previously both were silently mapped to the same key), and writes data + metadata atomically; the S3 and GCS `get()` paths no longer make a redundant second network call per read.
- Release pipeline now downloads the `mockserver-k8s-webhook` jar artifact before building its image, so the webhook image is published reliably on multi-agent CI.

### Added
- First-class LLM and agent mocking: new `httpLlmResponse` action type lets you mock LLM provider APIs at the semantic level — describe the model's reply (text, tool calls, stop reason, usage) and MockServer produces the byte-correct provider wire format. Supports all 7 major providers: Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama. Non-streaming responses return provider-correct JSON; streaming responses generate the full SSE event sequence (e.g. `message_start` through `message_stop` for Anthropic, `chat.completion.chunk` with `finish_reason` for OpenAI) with configurable timing physics (`timeToFirstToken`, `tokensPerSecond`, `jitter`). OpenAI embeddings are also supported with deterministic vector generation via `deterministicFromInput()`.
- Conversation-aware matchers for multi-turn agent testing: `whenTurnIndex(n)`, `whenLatestMessageContains(text)`, `whenLatestMessageRole(role)`, and `whenContainsToolResultFor(toolName)` predicates match against the parsed `messages` array in the inbound request body, enabling scripted multi-turn conversations where turn 1 returns a `tool_use` and turn 2 (after the agent sends a `tool_result`) returns the final answer. All predicates compose with AND semantics and integrate with the scenario state machine for automatic turn advancement.
- Per-session conversation isolation via `isolateBy(header("x-session-id"))`, `isolateBy(queryParameter("agent"))`, or `isolateBy(cookie("sid"))`: each unique value of the configured attribute gets independent scenario state, so concurrent agents sharing the same mocked endpoint do not interfere. Missing attributes fall back to shared state gracefully.
- `mock_llm_completion` MCP tool: set up a single-turn LLM expectation from the MCP control plane, specifying provider, path, model, text, tool calls, and streaming mode
- `create_llm_conversation` MCP tool: build a multi-turn scenario-chained LLM conversation with optional per-session isolation from the MCP control plane; returns the generated scenario name and per-turn state values
- LLM Response badge in the dashboard expectation row showing provider, model, and text preview; Conversation view extended with a scripted-turns panel
- `mockserver.maxLlmConversationBodySize` configuration property (default 1 MiB; clamped to 16 KiB - 64 MiB; env var `MOCKSERVER_MAX_LLM_CONVERSATION_BODY_SIZE`): request bodies larger than this limit skip conversation-aware parsing and are treated as no-match, preventing DoS via oversized JSON payloads
- Custom json-unit matcher support for JSON body matching: implement `org.mockserver.matchers.CustomJsonUnitMatcherProvider` and point `mockserver.customJsonUnitMatchersClass` at it to register named Hamcrest matchers that JSON body expectations can reference via the `${json-unit.matches:name}` placeholder (e.g. `{ "price": "${json-unit.matches:largerThan}" }`); misconfigured providers are logged at WARN and ignored, so matching never fails because of an unloadable extension (fixes #2279)
- `http2Enabled` configuration property to disable HTTP/2: when set to false ALPN no longer advertises `h2` (and h2c is not detected) so HTTP/2 capable clients fall back to HTTP/1.1
- Agent-friendly mismatch diagnostics: `explain_unmatched_requests` MCP tool and `PUT /mockserver/explainUnmatched` REST endpoint return recent requests that matched no expectation, each with ranked closest-expectation diffs and actionable remediation hints (e.g., "use method POST not GET", "add missing header Authorization"); `debug_request_mismatch` results are now ranked by closeness and include remediation hints; new `mockserver://unmatched` MCP resource
- `create_expectations_from_recorded_traffic` MCP tool: converts traffic recorded by MockServer's forwarding/proxy mode into active mock expectations in one call, enabling an "observe then mock" workflow; supports `method`/`path` filtering and `preview` mode to inspect expectations before activating them
- OpenAPI contract verification MCP tools: `verify_traffic_against_openapi` validates recorded request-response pairs against an OpenAPI spec (passive conformance checking); `run_contract_test` sends example requests derived from an OpenAPI spec to a running service and validates the responses (active contract testing); both return structured per-operation pass/fail results with validation errors
- OpenAPI resiliency testing MCP tool: `run_resiliency_test` sends deliberately malformed and boundary-case requests derived from an OpenAPI spec to a running service (omitting required fields, type violations, numeric/string boundary violations, oversized strings, malformed JSON) and classifies each outcome as HANDLED (4xx) or UNEXPECTED (5xx/2xx/error); returns per-mutation results with operation summaries
- Deterministic LLM record/replay: `record_llm_fixtures` MCP tool snapshots LLM/MCP traffic recorded through MockServer's forwarding proxy into a committable JSON fixture file with secrets automatically redacted (Authorization, api-key, Cookie, etc.); SSE streaming responses (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) are converted to `HttpSseResponse` actions for faithful event-by-event replay; `load_expectations_from_file` MCP tool loads fixture files as active expectations for offline, deterministic, zero-cost test replay

### Changed
- **BREAKING** Inbound HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 request bodies are now capped at 10 MiB by default (`mockserver.maxRequestBodySize`). Previously unbounded. Requests larger than the limit are rejected with `413 Payload Too Large`. Raise the limit (e.g. `-Dmockserver.maxRequestBodySize=52428800`) if you intentionally mock large uploads.
- **BREAKING** Upstream response bodies received when MockServer is acting as a proxy or forwarder are now capped at 50 MiB by default (`mockserver.maxResponseBodySize`). Previously unbounded. Raise if you forward to services that legitimately return larger payloads.
- Each published JAR (including the `-no-dependencies` shaded artifacts) now declares a stable `Automatic-Module-Name` in its `MANIFEST.MF`, so downstream JPMS consumers can `requires` MockServer modules with names that no longer change with each version: `org.mockserver.core` (`mockserver-core`), `org.mockserver.client` (`mockserver-client-java`), `org.mockserver.netty` (`mockserver-netty`), `org.mockserver.test` (`mockserver-testing`), `org.mockserver.testing` (`mockserver-integration-testing`), `org.mockserver.junit.rule` (`mockserver-junit-rule`), `org.mockserver.junit.jupiter` (`mockserver-junit-jupiter`), `org.mockserver.springtest` (`mockserver-spring-test-listener`), `org.mockserver.examples` (`mockserver-examples`), `org.mockserver.maven` (`mockserver-maven-plugin`); each `*-no-dependencies` shaded variant shares its unshaded counterpart's module name and is an alternative packaging (place only one on the JPMS module path)

### Fixed
- Dynamic CA / SSL certificate generation no longer fails when `dynamicallyCreateCertificateAuthorityCertificate=true` (or any auto-generated server certificate path) is used: the four `Configuration` fluent setters for `certificateAuthorityCertificate`, `certificateAuthorityPrivateKey`, `privateKeyPath`, and `x509CertificatePath` no longer file-existence-check at set-time, because the internal generator sets these to the destination path before the file is written. User-supplied path typos are still surfaced by `CertificateConfigurationValidator` at TLS-init time.
- HTTP/2 requests through the HTTPS CONNECT forward proxy no longer hang and emit a GOAWAY after ~30s; the internal relay now negotiates HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 per connection via ALPN instead of mismatching its TLS layer and codec (fixes #2260)
- Docker image and standalone executable JAR produced no log output because the shaded server JAR did not include an SLF4J logging provider (fixes #2097)
- `*-no-dependencies` shaded artifacts leaked their un-shaded source module (and its transitive dependencies) onto consumers' classpaths; these artifacts are now truly dependency-free

## [6.0.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

**Protocol & transport**
- gRPC protocol mocking without a grpc-java dependency: upload a Protobuf descriptor and mock unary, client-streaming, server-streaming, and bidirectional-streaming RPCs; `GrpcStreamResponse` supports multi-frame streaming responses
- GraphQL body matching: whitespace-normalised query comparison, `operationName` matching, and `variablesSchema` JSON Schema validation for variables
- binary request/response mocking via `BinaryRequestDefinition` and `BinaryResponse` for non-HTTP protocols
- DNS mocking with `dnsEnabled`/`dnsPort` configuration and support for A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, SRV, TXT, and PTR record types
- IPv6 CONNECT proxy support including correctly bracketed IPv6 address handling in the `CONNECT` tunnel

**Request matching**
- probabilistic expectation matching: set a `percentage` field (0–100) on an expectation so only a fraction of matching requests are served by it, enabling fault-injection scenarios (fixes #2122)
- HTTP method factory methods on `HttpRequest`: `HttpRequest.get(path)`, `.post(path)`, `.put(path)`, `.delete(path)`, `.patch(path)`, `.head(path)`, `.options(path)` for more concise expectation definitions (fixes #1509)

**Responses & actions**
- multi-response expectations: define an `httpResponses` list with a `responseMode` of `SEQUENTIAL` (cycle repeatedly through the list in order) or `RANDOM` (pick at random) to serve different responses on successive matched requests
- multi-action expectations: compose response, forward, and callback actions in a single expectation with a primary action and post-action callbacks
- stateful scenarios with atomic state transitions: gate expectations behind named states and advance through them by setting `newScenarioState` on the expectation, making it straightforward to model multi-step protocols
- CRUD simulation via `PUT /mockserver/crud`: supply a data model and MockServer auto-generates a fully stateful REST API (list, create, read, update, delete) backed by an in-memory store
- `FileBody` response body type that loads content from a file path at response time, useful for large or binary payloads (fixes #2163)
- in-memory file store: upload files via `PUT /mockserver/files/store`, retrieve via `PUT /mockserver/files/retrieve`, list via `PUT /mockserver/files/list`, and delete via `PUT /mockserver/files/delete`; stored files can be referenced by `FileBody` (fixes #1652)
- `respondBeforeBody` flag on the request matcher to dispatch the configured response (and optionally close the connection) before MockServer reads the request body, useful for reproducing client behaviour when a server responds and closes mid-upload (fixes #1831)

**Delays & timing**
- response delays with statistical distributions (uniform, Gaussian, log-normal) for realistic latency simulation (fixes #1688)
- global response delay via `mockserver.globalResponseDelayMillis` configuration property to add a baseline delay to every response
- connection timeout emulation via `mockserver.connectionDelayMillis` configuration property: a configurable delay before protocol detection fires, so slow-connect scenarios can be tested without a real network (fixes #1604)
- chunked dribble delay via `ConnectionOptions.withChunkSize()` / `withChunkDelay()` to drip-feed any response body in configurable-size chunks at a configurable rate

**Response templates**
- template helper functions: JWT generation, string manipulation, JSON path extraction, date arithmetic, and math operations available inside JavaScript, Velocity, and Mustache templates

**Record & replay**
- HAR 1.2 export: pass `format=HAR` to the retrieve API to get a standard HAR file of all recorded requests and responses (fixes #2175)
- automatic persistence of recorded expectations: `persistRecordedExpectations` and `persistedRecordedExpectationsPath` configuration properties save recorded traffic to disk so it survives restarts (fixes #2175)

**Debugging & diagnostics**
- per-expectation match count tracking: each expectation now exposes an invocation counter so tests can assert exactly how many times an endpoint was hit
- closest-match tracking: when a request does not match any expectation, MockServer identifies the expectation with the most fields satisfied and surfaces it via the API and dashboard
- `debugMismatch()` client method and `PUT /mockserver/debugMismatch` endpoint to programmatically retrieve the closest-match analysis for the last unmatched request
- match failure hints: actionable suggestions attached to `EXPECTATION_NOT_MATCHED` log events to guide correction of common mistakes
- "Why didn't this match?" debug dialog in the dashboard: click any unmatched request to see a field-by-field comparison against the closest expectation with per-field pass/fail indicators
- expectation ID included in `EXPECTATION_NOT_MATCHED` log messages to make it easier to correlate log output with the intended expectation (fixes #1937)

**Logging**
- compact log format: set `mockserver.compactLogFormat=true` to emit single-line JSON log entries instead of multi-line formatted output (fixes #1510)
- per-category log level overrides via `mockserver.logLevelOverrides` so individual event types can have different log levels (fixes #1694)
- correlation ID retrieval: `retrieveLogsByCorrelationId()` client method and a correlationId chip in the dashboard for tracing a single request across all related log events
- `retrieveLogEntries()` client method returning typed `LogEntry` objects with optional time-range filtering; pass `LOG_ENTRIES` as the format to the retrieve API for programmatic access
- custom log event listener via a `Consumer<LogEntry>` callback registered with the `Configuration` object, enabling integration with external observability tools (fixes #1960)

**Proxy & forwarding configuration**
- `mockserver.forwardDefaultHostHeader` configuration property: set a specific `Host` header value to send on all forwarded requests, overriding the original client `Host` header (fixes #1782)
- `mockserver.proxyRemoteHost` and `mockserver.proxyRemotePort` configuration properties to route all proxy traffic through an upstream proxy (fixes #1753)
- request forwarding timings captured per forwarded request: both connect time and total round-trip time are available in the log and dashboard (fixes #1574)

**OpenAPI**
- OpenAPI callback support: MockServer reads `callbacks` entries in an OpenAPI specification and automatically creates `AfterAction` webhook expectations (fixes #1483)

**TLS & security**
- BouncyCastle FIPS provider support for environments that require FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptography (fixes #1769)
- support for custom TLS protocols TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3
- better error messages when MockServerClient fails due to TLS or networking errors

**Client & test integration**
- `@MockServerTest` now applies `mockserver.*` prefixed properties to the per-instance MockServer `Configuration` object, enabling declarative configuration of `initializationClass`, `logLevel`, `maxExpectations`, and other settings directly in the annotation (fixes #1554)
- Jackson `StreamReadConstraints` maximum string length raised to 100 MB to handle large JSON bodies without `StreamConstraintsException` (fixes #1754)

**Build & deployment**
- Maven plugin `initializationJson` now accepts glob patterns to load multiple expectation files from a directory (fixes #2231)
- `mockserver/mockserver:graaljs` Docker image tag that bundles the GraalJS engine JARs, enabling native ECMAScript 2022 support in response templates without Nashorn
- Docker HEALTHCHECK instruction added to all official images so container orchestrators can determine readiness without an external probe
- Helm chart `podLabels` value to attach arbitrary labels to MockServer pods, useful for service-mesh injection and internal routing rules (fixes #1884)

### Changed
- BREAKING: removed implicit reliance on internal java-certificate-classes (thanks to @Arkinator)
- BREAKING: the `classifier=shaded` form of `mockserver-client-java`, `mockserver-netty`, `mockserver-junit-jupiter`, `mockserver-junit-rule`, and `mockserver-spring-test-listener` is no longer published. Use the corresponding `*-no-dependencies` artifactId instead (e.g. depend on `mockserver-netty-no-dependencies` rather than `mockserver-netty` with `<classifier>shaded</classifier>`). The `*-no-dependencies` variants are now proper Maven modules and are the supported way to consume a shaded MockServer jar.

### Fixed

**Proxy & forwarding**
- proxy forwarding failures now return `502 Bad Gateway` instead of `404 Not Found`, making it clearer to clients that the upstream could not be reached (fixes #1519)
- `Host` header updated to match the forwarding target to prevent `421 Misdirected Request` errors from strict servers (fixes #1897)
- request/response bodies with `Content-Encoding` are now re-compressed correctly when forwarding, preventing garbled bodies on the upstream (fixes #1668)
- `Transfer-Encoding` header preserved on forwarded responses; spurious `Content-Length` header no longer added when `Transfer-Encoding` is present (fixes #1733)

**Request & response handling**
- cookie values starting with `!` were corrupted in forwarded responses (fixes #1875)
- duplicate query parameter values are now preserved instead of being deduplicated (fixes #1866)
- binary response bodies (e.g. `application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8`) were corrupted because a `charset` parameter in `Content-Type` caused the body to be treated as a string; now correctly treated as binary (fixes #1910)
- JSON body serialization preserved numeric precision — `0.00` was incorrectly serialized as `0.0` (fixes #1740)

**OpenAPI**
- `ByteArraySchema` (`string` format `byte`) properties were omitted from generated OpenAPI examples (fixes #1788)
- `$ref` inside OpenAPI example values was not resolved, leading to raw `$ref` strings in generated responses (fixes #1474)
- `allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf` composed schemas now generate merged example responses (fixes #1852)
- OAS 3.0 boolean `exclusiveMinimum`/`exclusiveMaximum` now correctly translated to JSON Schema Draft-07 numeric format (fixes #1896)
- OpenAPI 3.1 `types` array field now correctly preserved during schema serialization (fixes #1940)

**XML**
- XSD schemas with `xs:include` or `xs:import` using relative paths now resolve correctly (fixes #2118)

**JUnit & Spring integration**
- `@MockServerTest` field injection now works in `@Nested` JUnit 5 test classes (fixes #1979)
- double server start when `@MockServerSettings` (carrying `@ExtendWith`) is combined with explicit `MockServerExtension` registration is now prevented (fixes #1977)
- `clientCertificateChain`, `localAddress`, and `remoteAddress` fields on `HttpRequest` were serialized but not deserialized — both directions now work (fixes #1973)
- `MockServerClient` parameter injection now works with `@TestInstance(PER_CLASS)` where the test instance is created before `@BeforeAll` (fixes #1621)
- `ClassNotFoundException` for callback classes when running in a Spring Boot uber JAR (fixes #1571)

**Dashboard & WebSocket**
- dashboard WebSocket returned 404 when MockServer was running behind a reverse proxy with a path prefix (fixes #1693)
- HTTP/2 `CONNECT` proxy no longer hangs when the client advertises `h2` via ALPN (fixes #1933)
- WebSocket upgrade over HTTP/2 is now rejected cleanly instead of hanging the dashboard (fixes #1803)

**Concurrency & thread safety**
- `Times.remainingTimes()` made thread-safe with `AtomicInteger` to prevent race conditions under concurrent load (fixes #1834)
- `XmlStringMatcher` made thread-safe by creating a new `DiffBuilder` per match instead of sharing one (fixes #1796)
- Disruptor ring buffer is drained before `verify()` to prevent false-positive or false-negative results under high throughput (fixes #1757)
- expired TTL expectations are now filtered from the event bus and event bus subscribers are cleared after publish to prevent stale matches (fixes #1847, #1874)

**TLS & mTLS**
- mTLS (data-plane) enforcement moved from transport layer to application layer, fixing scenarios where client certificate validation was applied to non-mTLS connections (fixes #1766)

**Docker & deployment**
- `netty-tcnative` native libraries no longer bundled in the shaded JAR, preventing native library conflicts (fixes #1778)
- Helm chart sub-chart deployments generated conflicting Kubernetes resource names when chart name was omitted (fixes #1752)

**Glob & file initialization**
- glob brace expansion in `initializationJson` path failed to find the starting directory in some environments (fixes #1715)
- `WebSocket` channel leak when the `CircularHashMap` evicted the oldest callback client (fixes #1543)
- verify failure message incorrectly said "was not found" even when matching requests existed; message now accurately describes the mismatch (fixes #1789)
