# MockServer Ruby Examples

Runnable examples demonstrating the [MockServer Ruby client](../../mockserver-client-ruby/).

## Prerequisites

- **Ruby 3.0+**
- **MockServer running** on `localhost:1080` (e.g. `docker run -d -p 1080:1080 mockserver/mockserver`)
- **Install the client gem** -- either from the local source:

  ```bash
  cd ../../mockserver-client-ruby && gem build mockserver-client.gemspec && gem install mockserver-client-*.gem
  ```

  or from RubyGems:

  ```bash
  gem install mockserver-client
  ```
